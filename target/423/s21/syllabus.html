<H3>Course Description and Goals </h3>

From the Catalog: Implementation of compilers for higher level computer
languages including: parsing, symbol table management,
code emission, and code optimization. Each student
implements a small compiler and designs an optimizing
compiler as a substantial portion of the course grade.
Individual and group projects. Practice in developing
software requirement, specification, design, and test plan
documents.

<p>

Goals include: learn how to write and connect a scanner, parser, semantic
analyzer and code generator into a simple working compiler. Learn notations
and tools used by developers of compilers. Understand symbol tables and
type checking. Know primary challenges associated with code generation.


<H3>Attendance and Grading </H3>

Attendance is required. I may or may not take attendance each session.
The grading will be proportioned as follows: 50%
for homeworks/quizzes, 25% for the midterm exam, 25% for the final exam.
Expect course content to be added on-line as we go.  Check the course web
page for updates at least once a week.


<h3> Exams, Homeworks, and Quizzes </h3>

We will have exams and homeworks.  Read the assigned text chapters.
Exams test your mastery of concepts;
homeworks allow you to demonstrate that you can put ideas into practice.

<h3> Student Outcomes </h3>

This course develops student proficiency and assesses student outcomes in
areas such as the following:

<ul>
<li> Analyze a complex computing problem and apply principles of computing
and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions.
<li> Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals
to produce computing-based solutions.
</ul>

<H3> Policy Statements </H3>

<FONT SIZE=1>Cheating in all forms is strictly forbidden, with severe
penalties. For homeworks you are required to work alone unless the
assignment states explicitly otherwise. You are encouraged to seek
assistance from your instructor on-line or in person. You may
discuss assignments with classmates, but Do Not Share Code.
