<h2> CSE 423 Lab #12: Control Flow in Intermediate Code </h2>

Turnin: a .zip on Canvas
<p>

This week's lab consists of practice and Q&amp;A
with the control flow aspects of intermediate code.

<h3> Using a Label Maker </h3>

<h4>1. Add fields to tree nodes to hold labels </h4>

<ul>
<li> These are .first, .follow, .onTrue, .onFalse
<li> You may want a bool (flag) for each to say if they are ever used!
</ul>


<h4>2. Add a genlabel() function</h4>

The prototype
<pre>
struct addr genlabel();
</pre>
that returns a unique label each time it is called.

<pre>
int counter;
struct addr genlabel()
{
   struct addr a;
   a.region = R_LABEL;
   a.offset = counter++;
   return a;
}
</pre>

<h4>3. Write traversal functions that assign labels </h4>

<dl>
<dt>3.1 Write a traversal function that assign .first labels.
<dd>
<ul>
<li> What type of attribute is it? synthesized.
<li> What type of traversal? Bottom-up postfix.
<li> What type of production rules need these? Anything that could
     be a target.
</ul>

<pre>
void assign_first(struct tree *t)
{  int i;
   for(i=0; i&lt;t-&gt;nkids; i++) assign_first(t-&gt;kids[i]);
   switch(t->prodrule) {
     /* ??? */
   }
}
</pre>



<dt>3.2 Write a traversal function that assign .follow labels.
<dd>
<ul>
<li> What type of attribute is it? inherited.
<li> What type of traversal? Bottom-up postfix.
<li> What type of production rules need these? Anything that could
     be a target.
</ul>

<dt>3.3 Write a traversal function that assign .onTrue and .onFalse labels.
<dd>
These both depend on the .first and the .follow.
<ul>
<li> What type of attribute is it??
<li> What type of traversal??
<li> What type of production rules need these? Anything that could
     be a target.
</ul>
</dl>

<h3>Write traversal functions for codegen</h3>
Enough to do boolean exprs and while loops. From the lecture notes we might
want to start with enough to do:

<pre>void print(int i);
void main()
{
   int i;
   i = 0;
   while (i &lt; 20)
      i = i * i + 1;
   print(i);
}
</pre>

and if we managed that, extend it in various ways, enough to handle e.g.:

<pre>void print(int i);
void main()
{
   int i;
   i = 0;
   while (i &lt; 20 && i%3==1)
      i = i + 1;
   print(i);
}
</pre>


<h3> What to turn in </h3>

Your compiler, with enough codegen efforts to reflect 2 hours worth of work.
