<h3> CS 423 HW#7 </h3>

Due: Sunday May 2 11:59pm
<p>

Generate final code for c113c.  Please turnin via bblearn an electronic copy
of your whole project in a hw7.zip.

Take your compiler, and add target code generation. The default target
is <A href="code-c.html">TAC-C</A> code; a more ambitious target is
<A href="code.html">x86_64 assembler</A> code.
<p>
<!--You may generate code for some other target if the instructor approves of
the target in advance; generally, approvals will be granted for lower
level language targets that run on lovecraft.cs.nmt.edu.-->
<p>

Finals week demos: if you have substantial new functionality to show, you
are invited to demonstrate your compilerto your professor in its final state
on Monday or Tuesday of finals week.  This allows you to show what works
and ensures that you get credit for as much as you are able to accomplish.
Minor corrections and resubmission will be allowed in reponse to a finals
week demo.


<h4> Notes </h4>
<ul>
<li> your executable should still be named "c113c"
<li> your program should accept and process an arbitrary
	number of source filenames on the command line
<li> take in files with .c extensions and write out corresponding
     final code in files with an appropriate (e.g. .s) extension.
     If generating the default (TAC-C), take in a file foo.c and
     write out a file foo.tac.c
<li> write out the name of the file to standard out when you open it
<li> do NOT write out the tree, or other debugging information, by default;
     you may add command line options to print that info if you want.
<li> error messages should be written to <em>standard error</em> not stdout
<li> If no errors and -s was given, generate assembler (as)
<li> If no errors and -c was given, call the assembler (as) or compiler (cc)
     to produce an object code file in your target language.
<li> If no errors and no -c was given, call the assembler or compiler to
     produce a .o file, and if that was successful, go ahead and call a
     linker and produce an executable
<li> if ANY file has a lexical error,
     your process exit status should return 1,
     for a syntax error 2, for a semantic error 3, and for no errors,
     return 0.
</ul>
