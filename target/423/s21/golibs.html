<h3> On standard library functions </h3>

This is a commentary on Go, I think. <p>

I started with just Println, but it is pretty hard to write even toy
programs if you can't read in input. What should we do?

<p>

<table border><tr><td>
<pre>reader = bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
text, _ = reader.ReadString('\n')
</pre>
<td>

<h3> Playing with a Real Go Compiler</h3>

One way to tell what your compiler should do in VGo is to compare it with
what a real Go compiler does on any given input. I played with
one and immediately learned some things:

<ul>
<li> go compiler command line arguments require a subcommand:
<pre>
   go run hello.go   # executes immediately
   go build hello.go # compiles to an executable named "hello"
</pre>
<li> for me, "go build" worked but the resulting executable
     did not have its execute-permission bit set !? You might have to
<pre>
   chmod u+x hello
</pre>
<li> Go's semi-colon insertion has at least one major laughable consequence
     that we may also live with: open-curly to start a function body has
     to be on the same line where the "func" was:
<p>

<table>
<tr><td>
<pre>
func main() {
   ...
}
</pre>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<td>
<pre>
func main()
{
   ...
}
</pre>
</table>
</ul>


<h3> What to do about Go's standard library functions, cont'd </h3>

We will do a literal, minimalist interpretation of what is necessary
to support functions like reader.ReadString(). VGo will support two kinds of
calls: ones that return a single value, and ones that return a single value
plus a boolean flag that indicates whether the function succeeded or failed.
