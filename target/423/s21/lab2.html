<h2> CSE 423 Lab #2: Flex </h2>

Turnin: on Canvas.

<p>

<h4> 0. Preliminaries </h4>

If you haven't already, read the required Flex reading (sections 3-5
of the GNU Flex Manual). If that's not enough, read the Flex chapters
of the optional text (Flex and Bison), or find and read a copy of the
original Paxon article "Flex - a scanner generator".

<h4>1. Flex Basics </h4>

Use Flex to compile and run the "word counter" flex program from the
Flex manual page, or <A href="flex-wc.l">flex-wc.l</A>, a version I
found on github.

<ol>
<li> When you run <code>flex flex-wc.l</code>, what output file
      does flex write?
<li> When you run <code>gcc lex.yy.c</code>, what is the executable file
      named?
<li> Run your program on itself with <code>./a.out &lt;flex-wc.l</code>
<li> Fix your program to take the name of the file as a command line
     argument, instead of using &lt; to redirect standard input.
<li> Convert to separate compilation!  move main() into a separate main.c
     and write a makefile that compiles main.c and lex.yy.c separately and
     then links them.
</ol>

<h4>2. Flex your HW#2 Away</h4>

Well, you can save the "allocate tokens and build a linked list of them"
part for later, but if you complete this lab, you should have your regular
expressions identified, and have integer codes for each category.

<ol>
<li> Copy flex-wc.l to a file named c113c.l
<li> Modify c113c.l to discard whitespace, but otherwise count chars/words
<li> Modify c113c.l to discard C comments, but otherwise count chars/words
<li> Modify c113c.l to return a 257 on each word, and modify the main()
     to call yylex() in a while loop. Print chars and words at the end.
<li> Change the while loop to print out a line showing each word after
     yylex() returns it. Print the return code as well as <code>yytext</code>
<li> Add regular expressions to recognize reserved words (see
     <A href="c113c.html">c113c.html</A> for a list) and return
     different integers for each one.
<li> Add regular expressions for operators and punctuation  (see
     <A href="c113c.html">c113c.html</A> for lists) and return
     different integers for each one.
<li> Add regular expressions for integer, float, character and string
     literals
</ol>
