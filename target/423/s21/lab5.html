<h2> CSE 423 Lab #5: Syntax Tree-age </h2>

Turnin: no turnin, your HW#3 is your turnin
<p>

This week's lab will be completely free-form, the time will be spent just
helping out anyone who needs help with HW#3 and is willing to share their
screen with the class.  If you are done with HW#3, you are not required
to attend.

<p>

If you don't have questions for the instructor, I will kick around various
thoughts on error messaging and recovery and/or testing.
<p>

What will it take to adequately test our compilers?
<dl>
<dt> Just run "a lot" of tests?
<dd> As a starting point, you may want to look for what's available for free
on the internet.  If you haven't already found
<A href="https://github.com/c-testsuite/c-testsuite">https://github.com/c-testsuite/c-testsuite</A>, it is a possible starting point. 220 tests. Other C
validation suites might have thousands. But do they test everything?
(Most test suites that test everything for ANSI C might be commer$ial.)
Since c113c is smaller than ANSI C, which tests are legal c113c tests?

<dt> Lexical test coverage
<dd>  - torture tests of the boundaries of what is legal. Tests that use
      every token, including every
      operator and reserved word.  Testing multi-byte tokens to see what
      happens if they have weird stuff on the ends. Testing C99 and C11
      stuff to see if they choke on it.
<dt> Syntax test coverage
<dd>  - tests that use every production in the grammar.  Testing every
     illegal combination of tokens.
<dt> ... more to come, e.g. semantic test coverage
