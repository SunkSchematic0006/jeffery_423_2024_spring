<h2> CSE 423 Lab #6: Hashing and Symbol Tables </h2>

Turnin: on canvas. Due Friday 3/5, 11:59pm
<p>

This week's lab asks you to implement a symbol table data type.
Turn in as far as you get by Friday evening; you will be graded as
having done the lab as long as it looks like you did two or more
hours of work.

<p>

<h4> Symbols </h4>

Write a syntax tree traversal function printsyms(struct tree *) that calls
the following helper function for each identifier. You will use it in
today's lab only.

<pre>
void printsymbol(char *s)
{
   printf("%s\n", s); fflush(stdout);
}
</pre>

Integrate a call to printsyms into your compiler, calling it on the root of
your syntax tree for each file.  If you run this on all the source files of
your compiler (*.[chly]), how many symbols occur?  You can pipe the results
into UNIX <code>wc(1)</code> for a quick count.  Then pipe the results into
UNIX <code>uniq</code> to see how many unique symbols there are after removing
duplicates.


<h4> Symbol Table Entries </h4>

A symbol table is a collection of symbol table entries.  For today, each
entry has an empty data payload; there is nothing in it except the symbol
itself and all it can be used for is to answer the yes/no question of
whether the symbol is declared in a given scope.

<pre>
typedef struct sym_entry {
/*   SymbolTable table;			/* what symbol table do we belong to*/
   char *s;				/* string */
   /* more symbol attributes go here for code generation */
   struct sym_entry *next;
   } *SymbolTableEntry;
</pre>

Put this in a header file, symtabentry.h.
Whatever modules #include this file, should have it added to their makefile
dependencies. To add it to foo.c:
<pre>
foo.o: foo.c <font color=red>symtabentry.h</font>
	gcc $(CFLAGS) foo.c
</pre>

<h4> A Symbol table that is a linked list</h4>

You can build a symbol table as a linked list
first, and then turn it into a hash table if you have time.

<pre>
typedef struct sym_table {
   int nEntries;			/* # of symbols in the table */
/*   struct sym_table *parent;		/* enclosing scope, superclass etc. */
   struct sym_entry *next;
   /* more per-scope/per-symbol-table attributes go here */
   } *SymbolTable;
</pre>

Write a constructor function mksymtab() to create one of these symbol tables
and return a pointer to it.

<h4> Symbol Table Population </h4>

Walk through your tree, looking for nodes whose production rule indicates
that they are variable declarations.  Find the list of variable names and
insert them into the current symbol table (scope).
<p>



<h4>A hash function </h4>

You can use this one, or anything better that you can invent or find,
so long as you cite sources.

<pre>
int hash(SymbolTable st, char *s)
{
   register int h = 0;
   register char c;
   while (c = *s++) {
      h += c & 0377;
      h *= 37;
      }
   if (h < 0) h = -h;
   return h % st->nBuckets;
}
</pre>


<h4> Symbol Table that uses an Array of Linked Lists </h4>

<pre>
typedef struct sym_table {
   int nBuckets;			/* # of buckets */
   int nEntries;			/* # of symbols in the table */
/*   struct sym_table *parent;		/* enclosing scope, superclass etc. */
   struct sym_entry **tbl;
   /* more per-scope/per-symbol-table attributes go here */
   } *SymbolTable;
</pre>

<h4> Wrapping Up: How do you tell you have your symbols in place? </h4>
