<h2> CSE 423 Lab #4: Trees </h2>

Turnin: on Canvas in a .zip file.

<p>

<h4>1. Adding a tree type to your compiler </h4>

"Your compiler" in this case refers to the output of Lab #3, where you've
got Bison and Flex talking together as a syntax checker.

<ol>
<li> Add a <code>tree.h</code> file to your project, containing a
    <code>struct</code> definition as per
    HW#3, or your own preferred superset tree representation. Today's lab
    will be written as if your tree type is
<pre>
struct tree {
   int prodrule;
   char *symbolname;
   int nkids;
   struct tree *kids[9]; /* if nkids &gt;0 */
   struct token *leaf;   /* if nkids == 0; NULL for &epsilon; productions */
};
</pre>

Actually, to be honest, you probably want to write a full tree abstract data
type in a tree.c with functions to create, destroy, and traverse trees.
Initially for this lab, you will at least need functions to allocate and
initialize leaves and internal nodes.

<li> Add <code>#include "tree.h"</code> directives to the header of
     your lex and yacc specifications. Typically this is inside %{ ... %}:
     <pre>
%{
#include "tree.h"
%}
     </pre>
<li> Whenever you add an <code>#include</code> directive, you need to add
     a dependency to your
     <code>makefile</code> that will trigger recompilation if the include
     file is modified.
     In this case, the gcc compiles of lex.yy.o and cgram.tab.o depend on
     tree.h, not just lex.yy.c and cgram.tab.c.  Change rules like
<pre>
lex.yy.o : lex.yy.c
	gcc -c -g lex.yy.c
</pre>
to instead say
<pre>
lex.yy.o : lex.yy.c tree.h
	gcc -c -g lex.yy.c
</pre>
</ol>

<h4>2. Adding the %union to your bison </h4>

Once your Bison .y file knows about your tree type, you can add
<pre>
%union {
   struct tree *treeptr;
}
</pre>

to the header of cgram.y (or whatever your Bison file is called).
As shown in lecture #12 or so, adding this %union is one thing, and
using it in your grammar rules is another; you have to declare all
your terminal and non-terminal symbols as to what member (in this
case treeptr) before you can refer to them in actions as $$ or $1 etc.


<h4>3. Adding the leaves to your lex </h4>

It is time to make the leaves available to Bison.
With the %union declared, the output code that Bison writes will
have a variable named <code>yylval</code> of type YYSTYPE where
YYSTYPE is the union type given by %union.
<p>

On each shift action, the parser will copy (push) what is in yylval.treeptr
onto the value stack. So our lexer should allocates a tree leaf and assign
it to yylval.treeptr where we previously allocated a token and assigned it
to yytoken.
<p>

For some of you, this will be a small tweak, for others this is a major
change, depending on how you implemented your HW#2.  If you have
already performed a given step here, you may skip forward.

<ol>
<li> If you have raw return statements in your lex file like this:
<pre>
[0-9]+		{ return ICON; }
</pre>
You need to allocate your token inside your yylex() per HW#2 specs.
Something like the following.
<pre>
[0-9]+		{ return alctoken(ICON); }
</pre>
where alctoken() is a helper function that you write to allocate a token.
You have to do this (duh) for all the regular expressions that return a token.

<li> In your code to allocate a token, change it to allocate a leaf that
contains/wraps that token pointer.  Change
<pre>
int alctoken(int category){
   yytoken = malloc(sizeof (struct token));
   yytoken-&gt;cat = category;
   ...
   return category;
}
</pre>
to something like
<pre>
int alctoken(int category){
   yylval.treeptr = malloc(sizeof (struct tree));
   ... initialize other tree fields, prodrule = category, nkids = 0...
   yylval.treeptr-&gt;token = malloc(sizeof (struct token));
   yylval.treeptr-&gt;token-&gt;cat = category;
   ... initialize other token fields...
   return category;
}
</pre>
Note: you may want to write additional helper functions.
</ol>

<h4>4. Proving that you've got leaf information </h4>

There are two places where you could insert print statements to prove
that you have leaf information: from inside the Flex-generated yylex()
code, and from inside Bison-generated yyparse() code.

<ol>
<li> Write a print function, perhaps printnode(t) that can takes a pointer
     to a struct tree as a
     parameter, and prints a line of detailed information about it. For a
     tree leaf, have it print the tree's token information (text, line #...)
     as per HW#2.
<li> Inside the yylex() function, for example, inside an alctoken() function,
     you can call printnode() right before you return, to see all the tokens
     as they come out of yylex().
<li> From inside yyparse() things are a bit more hairy. Consider a
     grammar rule like
<pre>
     identifier : IDENTIFIER ;
</pre>
     Once you have declared <code>%token &lt;treeptr&gt; IDENTIFIER</code>
     in your you can print the token information for IDENTIFIER as follows:
<pre>
     identifier : IDENTIFIER { printnode($1); } ;
</pre>
     You could go ahead and print all your terminal symbols in all your rules
     in this way, but for this lab, you are asked to just do a couple
    categories to verify that the leaf information is present and usable.

</ol>


<h4>5. Adding internal nodes (not required for Lab 4, but in HW#) </h4>

Syntax tree construction consists of specifying for every
production rule in the grammar, what its corresponding syntax tree should
be, by assigning $$ a value.
<p>

<ol>
<li> For each production rule that has more than one child, allocate
an internal node. Example:
<pre>
translation_unit: translation_unit external_declaration {
        $$ = alctree(TU_TU_ED, "translation_unit", 2, $1, $2);
	} ;
</pre>

<li> Set $$ to NULL for epsilon productions.  Example:
<pre>
   parameters : { $$ = NULL; /* empty parameter list */ } ;
</pre>

Note that epsilon productions are a frequent cause of ambiguity
(e.g. reduce/reduce conflicts) and cgram.y goes way out of its way
to avoid doing any of these!


<li> Bison uses <code>$$=$1</code> as its default semantic action.
     This works great when a non-terminal has only one child.
     You don't have to write
     this semantic action at all. No <code>{ }</code> is required. Example: 
<pre>
   parameters : parameter_list ;
</pre>
     Note that you can add a semantic action here, such as one that
     allocates a tree node with one child. Do so if it will help you
     understand your tree afterwards.
<pre>
   parameters : parameter_list { $$ = alctree(PS_PL, "parameters", 1, $1); };
</pre>

<li> Write (or adapt from the HW#3 spec) a tree traverser to print your tree.
     You can either call it from the start symbol action, or set the root of
     the tree and call it after yyparse() returns. Either:
<pre>
file : translation_unit {
       tree_print($1); /* can call rest of compiler from here */
     } ;
</pre>
or define a global variable for the tree root
<pre>
file : translation_unit { root = $1; } ;
<pre>
... and then, after yyparse() in main:
<pre>
  tree_print(root);
</pre>

</ol>
