CS 445<br>
Homework Assignment 1: Lexical Analysis by Hand
</center>
</font>
<p>

Due: Thursday August 23, 11:30am (firm deadline)<p>

This first assignment is intended to be an easy warm-up and will be graded
in binary (1 or 0).  It must completed
and turned in successfully, electronically and on paper.

<p>

Write a C program that reads in text files and breaks
them up into lexemes (which are strings of one or more
non-whitespace characters).
Your program should discard spaces, tabs and newlines (called "whitespace"
from here on), and write each contiguous sequence of non-whitespace
characters on a separate line.  You should identify each lexeme's category
within the following table, and write the integer code on the line preceding
the characters from the lexeme.

<center>
<table border>
<tr><th>category name<th> integer code <th> description
<tr><td>identifier   <td> 1            <td> 1+ letters, initial lowerCase
<tr><td>name         <td> 2            <td> 1+ letters, first letter was Capital
<tr><td>number       <td> 3            <td> 1+ digits from 0-9, optional leading - and decimal point
<tr><td>punctuation  <td> 4            <td> something not in categories 1-3
<tr><td>mixture      <td> 5            <td> a mixture of characters from categories 1-4
</table>
</center>

<p>
In addition, you must do this following a particular organization, described
below to prepare you for the next assignment.

<dl>
<dt> Organization </dt>
<dd> Your program must include two source files named <tt>main.c</tt>
and <tt>yylex.c</tt> as well as a <tt>makefile</tt>.
<dt> Input and Output
<dd> Your input could be any file; no coredumps allowed even if I run it
on executable files!  But mainly it will be tested on "program source code"
files.  Your output should consist of one line per lexeme, each line
containing some non-whitespace character(s) that were grouped together.
<dt> main.c
<dd> Your main.c must contain a main() function that performs as follows:
<pre>
    FILE *yyin;
    char yytext[1024];
    /* The following is pseudocode; you must write C code. */
    for each filename given on the command line
	open the file and store its reference in global variable yyin
	repeat:
	    call function yylex() to obtain the next lexeme
	    if yylex() returns &lt;= 0, quit this loop
	    print the lexeme
	close the file, move to the next filename
</pre>
    See the course lecture notes web page for an example of reading files
    and command line argument processing in C.

<dt> yylex.c
<dd> Your yylex.c function must contain a function yylex() that performs
	several tasks.  Each time yylex() is called it processes one 
	lexeme of non-whitespace characters and stores them in an array
        of characters named yytext.
	yylex() returns a category (1, 2, 3, or 4) if it finds characters,
        and a -1 if it hits end of file. Details are given below:
<ul>
   <li> Discard whitespace characters, continue reading.
   <li> Return -1 if EOF (End of File) occurs before any non-whitespace
	character
   <li> Read from input until 1 or more non-whitespace
	characters are found in input.
   <li> Store as many contiguous (whitespace in the middle)
	characters as you can find in a NUL-terminated
	string in the global array named <code>yytext</code>.
   <li> Determine whether the lexeme is category 1, 2, 3, or 4 either as
        you put the characters into yytext, or by examine yytext afterwards.
   <li> Return a 1, 2, 3, or 4 if you found characters.
</ul>
<dt> makefile
<dd> You must write a makefile, per the discussion in class.
Your makefile must include separate rules to compile each source file
individually (a rule to build yylex.o and main.o) and a rule to link the
files together to form an executable file named scan.  The first (default)
rule should be the link rule, which should in turn depend on the other two
rules, so if I just type "make" your program will compile to an executable.
It must also include a rule named turnin that looks like the following,
where <em>userid</em> is your UNIX user id.
<pre>
turnin:
	tar cf <em>userid</em>.tar makefile main.c yylex.c
</pre>
</dl>

<p>
<br>
Example:
<p>

For the input file
<p>
<table border>
<tr><td>
<pre>

  void main() { printf(" Twelve =%d", 10 + 2); }&nbsp;&nbsp;
</table>
<p>

your output should look like:
<p>

<table>
<tr><td>
<pre>
1	void
5	main()
4	{
5	printf("
2	Twelve
5	=%d",
3	10
4	+
5	2);
4	}
</pre>
</table>

<p>
In the next few weeks, your scanner will have to become much smarter about
breaking up source code into actual words.

<h3> Turning your Program In </h3>

Please test your program carefully and then turn your program in
electronically using the cscheckin command:
<pre>
cscheckin -f warmup.tar -c cs445
</pre>
<p>

Please be careful to turn it in as your warmup.tar; cscheckin will stamp
your userid on it.  But please stick your name prominently in comments
at the top of each file.
My script must be able to unpack your assignment and
compile it in order for you to receive credit.  You will get your hard copy
back with written comments as well as the results from executing your
program on tests.<p>

Please also print a paper copy of your program and turn it in either in
class or to my office (JEB 230) by 11:30am.  If my door is not open,
you may slip assignments under the door.
