<h3> CS 445 HW#3 </h3>

Due: Wednesday October 3 start of class. Please do not print hard copies of
.tab.c (or lex.yy.c) files.  I would like hard copies of .y and other .[ch]
files.
<p>


Adapt a C grammar to be as close to C11 (classic ANSI C plus C99 and C11
extensions) as you can get
<p>
<ul>
<li> <A href="cgram.y">cgramy</A>, a classic ANSI C grammar
</ul>

<p>

<p>

If there is a syntax error, you should report the filename and line number.
Your program's exit status should return 0
if there are no errors, and a negative number to indicate errors. For
lexical errors, return -1. For syntax errors, return -2.
<p>

If there are no errors, you should print a text representation of the parse
tree.
<p>
Suppose we have a tree structure that looks something like:

<pre>
struct tree {
   int prodrule;
   int nkids;
   struct tree *kids[9];
   struct token *leaf;
}

int treeprint(struct tree *t, int depth)
{
  int i;

  printf("%*s %s: %d\n", depth*2, " ", humanreadable(t->prodrule), t->nkids);
  
  for(i=0; i&lt;t-&gt;nkids; i++)
    treeprint(t->kids[i], depth+1);

}
</pre>

you might get output that looks someething like

<pre>
program: 1
 function: 2
  function header: 3
   typedecl: 1
   functioname: 1
   parmlist: 3
    ....

</pre>

For leaves, print out the integer code and the lexeme (yytext[]) for the
token, if any.
