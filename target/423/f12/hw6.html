<h3> CS 445 HW#6 </h3>

Due: Friday December 14 12:00pm -- noon
<p>


Generate final code for Ct.
Please turnin cscheckin electronic copy of your whole
project in a hw6.tar but turnin paper copy only for those modules involved
in the code generation.


Take your Ct compiler, and add target code generation. You have two options:
<ol>
<li> <a href="code-c.html">TAC-C</A>: generate out C code with no more than 3 addresses per statement. (75 points)
<li> <a href="code.html">x86_64</A> assembler code (100 points)
</ol>
<p>
Note that Option #1 is easier and worth less points than Option #2.  It is
possible to end with an "A" doing option #1 if you ace midterm and final.
It is considerably easier to end with an "A" if you do option #2.

<p>

Finals week demos: you are encouraged to demonstrate your compiler
to your professor in its final state.  This allows you to show what works
and ensures that you get credit for as much as you are able to accomplish.


<h4> Notes </h4>
<ul>
<li> your executable should still be named "ct"
<li> your program should accept and process an arbitrary
	number of source filenames on the command line
<li> take in files with .ct extensions and write out corresponding
     final code in files with an appropriate (e.g. .s or .c) extension.
<li> write out the name of the file to standard out when you open it
<li> do NOT write out the tree, or other debugging information, by default;
     you may add command line options to print that info if you want.
<li> error messages should be written to <em>standard error</em> not stdout
<li> If no errors and -c was given, call the assembler (as) or compiler (cc)
     to produce an object code file in your target language.
<li> If no errors and no -c was given, go ahead and call a linker and
     produce an executable
<li> if ANY file has a lexical error,
     your process exit status should return 1,
     for a syntax error 2, for a semantic error 3, and for no errors,
     return 0.
</ul>
