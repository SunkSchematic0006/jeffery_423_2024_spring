<H3>Course Description and Goals </h3>

Algorithms used by the following system software: assemblers,
macro-processors, interpreters, and compilers; compiler design options and
code optimization; all concepts implemented in major programming
assignments.

<p>

Goals include: learn how to write and connect a scanner, parser, semantic
analyzer and code generator into a simple working compiler. Learn notations
and tools used by developers of compilers. Understand symbol tables and
type checking. Know primary challenges associated with code generation.


<H3>Attendance and Grading </H3>

Attendance is required.  The grading will be proportioned as follows: 50%
for quizzes/homeworks, 25% for the midterm exam, 25% for the final exam.
Expect course content to be added on-line as we go.  Check the course web
page for updates at least once a week.


<h3> Quizzes, Exams, and Homeworks </h3>

We will have quizzes, exams, and homeworks.  Quizzes will test your reading
comprehension; exams will test your mastery of concepts; homeworks will
allow you to demonstrate that you can put ideas into practice.



<H3> Policy Statements </H3>
<FONT SIZE=1>Cheating in all forms is strictly forbidden, with severe
penalties. For homeworks you are required to work alone unless the
assignment states explicitly otherwise. You are encouraged to seek
assistance from your instructor on-line or in person. You may
discuss assignments with classmates, but Do Not Share Code.
