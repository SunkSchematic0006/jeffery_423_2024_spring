<h3> CS 445 HW#4 </h3>

Due: Friday November 2 11:59pm
<p>

Perform the rest of semantic analysis for g0.  This shall consist
of the following items. Please turnin via bblearn an electronic copy of your
whole project in a .zip. Please create your .zip file in such a way that it
unpacks into the current directory, rather than a subdirectory.
<p>

Note: if you haven't already, add -Wall to your makefile compile rules,
and for maximum credit, turn in a solution that compiles with no warnings
when -Wall warnings have been turned on.


<dl>
<dt> Types
<dd> Support the g0 base types: int, double, string, bool and void.
     Support lists, tables, and classes

<dt> Type Checking
<dd> Require and check types everywhere at compile-time.
<ul>
<Li>    Check that function call signatures match
<Li>    Check that operators' operands are compatible
</ul>
<dt> Operators
<dd> The semantic rules for operators are all nearly the same; at the
     semantic analysis phase we will support at least
     the operators =, +, -, *, /, subscript ([ ]) and dot ( . ).
     Support the boolean/relational operators &lt, &gt; &amp;&amp; || and !.

<dt> Built-ins
<dd> You should insert into the global symbol table the names of
     built-in functions write() and read().

<dt> Nesting
<dd> Expressions will generally get combined to form larger expressions.
     In the object-oriented realm, you can expect expressions such as
     the following
<pre>
     o1.f(o2.g())
     a[i].m()
     (h.g()).i() == n
</pre>
</dl>

<p>

Notes:
<ul>
<li> your executable should be named "g0"

<li> your program should accept and process an arbitrary
	number of source filenames on the command line, treating
        them as one big program with a shared global name space.
<li> write out the name of each file to standard out when you open it
<li> do NOT write out the tree, or other debugging information, by default;
     you may add command line options to print that info if you want.
<li> error messages should be written to <em>standard error</em> not stdout
<li> if ANY file has a lexical error,
     your process exit status should return 1,
     for a syntax error 2, for a semantic error 3, and for no errors,
     return 0.

</ul>
