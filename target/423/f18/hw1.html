<h3>CS 445 Assignment 1: A Lexical Analyzer</h3>

Due: Thursday September 6, 11:59pm<p>

In this assignment you will write a lexical analyzer in
<code>flex(1)</code>, for a dialect of Godiva known as the <code>g0</code>
language. Note that a similar-sounding subset of Godiva called Godiva-0 is
documented in the main Godiva reference, but it is not the same
thing. Godiva-0 is a <em>research prototype</em> of Godiva, while
<code>g0</code> is an <em>instructional subset</em> of the Godiva
language that is documented in its own reference document, with a
link given below.

<h3> Engineering Requirements </h3>

In this and all subsequent assignments in 445, please meet the following
engineering requirements. Points will be assigned in grading for them.

<dl>
<dt> Mandatory .zip file unpacks to the current directory.
<dd> Turnin Must be a .zip containing a valid compressed archive that can
     be uncompressed on Linux via unzip. It may not be a .tar or a .rar
     or a .bzip or whatever, whether disguised or renamed or not.
     The .zip must unpack into the current directory, not a subdirectory.
<dt> "make" just works on cs-course42, build g0 executable.
<dd> You have to supply a makefile that contains build rules as follows.
<dt> Separate Compilation.
<dd> The C compiler must be invoked separately on each .c file.
     All .c files must be linked together via .o object files, no using
     <code>#include</code> of .c files.  No including any code (function
     bodies) in .h files.
<dt> No Warnings
<dd> The compiler must be invoked with -Wall on all compilation lines
<dt> Valgrind validation
<dd> You should test your work on cs-course42 both with and without valgrind.
     Valgrind output should be free of memory errors.  You will probably also
     become intimate with gdb in this class, but valgrind is your first line
     of defense.
</dl>

<h3> Feature Requiments </h3>

In this document, the term "must" indicates a feature that is
required for passing grade, while the term "should" indicates a feature
that is expected for a grade of "A" or "B".  If you do not know what
something means, or don't know how to do it, you are encouraged to ask
and find out rather than turning in a homework that does not meet the
specifications.

<p>

Your program executable should be named <code>g0</code>.  Your program
should read in any number of source files named on the command line and
write output with one line for each token, described below.  Source files
take the extension <code>.g0</code>. The compiler should automatically add
<code>.g0</code> to the end of filenames if no other extension is given. The
compiler automatically names the executable the same name as whatever file
contains procedure <code>main()</code>.  The command

<pre>
  $ g0 hello goodbye
</pre>

compiles <code>hello.g0</code> and <code>goodbye.g0</code> and name the
output binary executable <code>hello</code>.

<p>

Compilers and related tools are used by programs such as <code>make(1)</code>
that read the process exit status to tell whether all is well. Your
program's exit status should return 0 if there are no errors, and a nonzero
number to indicate errors. For lexical errors, return 1.

<h3> Language Details </h3>

The <code>g0</code> language is described at
<A href="http://www2.cs.uidaho.edu/~jeffery/godiva/g0.html">
http://www2.cs.uidaho.edu/~jeffery/godiva/g0.html</A>. As this
is a new language this semester, these details will be corrected
and amended as needed in response to student questions.

<h3> Lexical Attributes </h3>

In your <code>yylex()</code>, you should compute attributes for each token,
and store them in a global variable named <code>yytoken</code>. Note that
this is not part of the lex/yacc public interface, although it is named so
as to be a recognizable extension of said interface.  You should use the
following token type, or a compatible extension of it.

<p>

<pre>
struct token {
   int category;   /* the integer code returned by yylex */
   char *text;     /* the actual string (lexeme) matched */
   int lineno;     /* the line number on which the token occurs */
   char *filename; /* the source file in which the token occurs */
   int ival;       /* for integer constants, store binary value here */
   double dval;	   /* for real constants, store binary value here */
   char *sval;     /* for string constants, malloc space, de-escape, store */
                   /*    the string (less quotes and after escapes) here */
   }
</pre>

<p>

In this homework your <code>main()</code> procedure should 
build a LINKED LIST of all the token structs, each of which is created by
<code>yylex()</code>.  In the next assignment, we will
insert all these tokens in a giant (syntax) tree.<p>

Example linked list structure:

<pre>
   struct tokenlist {
      struct token *t;
      struct tokenlist *next;
      }
</pre>

Use the <code>malloc()</code> function to allocate chunks of memory for
<code>struct token</code> and <code> struct tokenlist</code>.

<h3> <code>yylex()</code> and <code>main()</code> </h3>

Your <code>yylex()</code> should return a different unique integer &gt; 257
for each reserved word, and for each other token category (identifier,
integer literal constant, string literal constant, addition operator, etc).
Numbers &gt; 257 are required for the sake of compatibility with the YACC
parser generator tool.  For each such number, you must <code>#define</code>
a symbol, as in

<pre>
#define IDENTIFIER 260
</pre>

This is required for the sake of readability.
Your <code>yylex()</code> should return -1 when it hits end of file.
<p>

In this assignment, there should be (at least) two separately-compiled .c
files, a .h file and a makefile. The <code>yylex()</code> function must be
called by a </code>main() procedure in a loop.  The main() procedure should
for each token, write out a line containing the token category (an integer
&gt; 257) and lexical attributes.

<h3> Turn in... </h3>

An electronic copy via bblearn.uidaho.edu.  The electronic copy should be a
compressed archive .zip file, containing makefile, flex clex.l file, main.c
file, and ytab.h file.  </pre>

If you add any new source files,
be sure you add it to the set of files that you turn in.

<h3> Example </h3>

<p>

For the input file
<p>
<table border>
<tr><td>
<pre>
void main() {
   write("Hello\tworld")
}
</pre>
</table>

<p>

your output should look something like the following. Integer categories
are for illustration purposes; yours may be different.

<p>

<table border>
<tr><td>
<pre>
Category	Text		Lineno		Filename	Ival/Sval
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
262		void		1		hello.c
271		main		1		hello.c
290		(		1		hello.c
291		)		1		hello.c
292		{		1		hello.c
271		write		2		hello.c
290		(		2		hello.c
271		"Hello\tworld"	2		hello.c		Hello	world
291		)		2		hello.c
293		}		3		hello.c
</pre>
</table>
