<h3> CS 445 HW#2 </h3>

Due: Sunday September 23 11:59pm.
<ul>
<li> Turnin on bblearn a .zip file named hw2.zip.
<li> The .zip should unpack in the current directory, include
a makefile and all files necessary to compile to executable.
<li> The compile should be free of warnings, other than shift/reduce
conflicts. After Fall 2018: makefile must use -Wall gcc option for all compiles
<li> Do not leave yydebug/YYDEBUG turned on.  Do not leave any spurious
     or debugging output in your submitted version. 
</ul>
<p>


Write or adapt a g0 grammar that works with Bison, and use it to produce
a syntax tree for your input g0 source files.
The recommended starting point is
<ul>
<!--
 <li> The 120++ reference implementation mods of
      files originally distributed by Sandro Sigala:
     <A href="120pp/120gram.y">120gram.y</A>,
     <A href="120pp/120lex.l">120lex.l</A>,
and
     <A href="120pp/Makefile">Makefile</A>
-->
     <A href="g0gram.y">g0gram.y</A>,
     along with your lexical analyzer in lieu of
     <A href="g0lex.l">g0lex.l</A>,
and
     this <A href="g0Makefile">Makefile</A>
     (work in progress, with help from you-all).
</ul>

To the extent that you modify the grammar, you are advised to ignore/allow
any number of shift/reduce conflicts, but to not tolerate any reduce/reduce
conflicts -- they generally require grammar changes such as refactoring
common sequences within two or more production rules. Whichever
grammar/parser you use, you are responsible
for making it work for g0 and for any bugs. You may write
your own grammar from scratch if you prefer.

<p>
Your parser should include at least the following:
<ul>
<li> If you want to use your hw#1 flex, rename terminal symbols from
     your HW#1 or from the grammar (.y file) so the two are compatible.
<li> Add terminal symbols required by the .y file, possibly adapting missing
     symbols' regular expressions from their .l file.
<li> Resolve matters regarding type names (for example, the names of classes)
     and the need to return
     different terminal symbol codes for "identifier" regular expressions,
     depending on syntactic context.
<li> For every production rule in the grammar:
<ul>
<li> if the right hand side has &gt; 1 children, add a semantic action to
     construct a construct a tree node and assign $$ to point at it
<li> if the right hand side
     has 0 or 1 children, add a semantic action to set $$ to NULL
     (0 children) or to the child if there is 1 child ($$ = $1).
</ul>
<li> Place a pointer to your token in a yylval field on each call to yylex(),
     and ensure that those tokens get inserted as leaves into your syntax
     tree.
<li> If the parse succeeds, assign the root of the tree to a global variable
     from the semantic action associated with your start symbol.
<li> Revise the main() procedure from HW#1 to call yyparse() and use its
return value and/or global variables to ascertain whether the parse succeeded.
<li> If the parse succeeded, traverse/print your syntax tree as described below.
<li> Add a reserved word bool to your lexical analyzer if you didn't have it,
     and include it as one of the basic types in your grammar.
</ul>

<p>

If there is a syntax error, you should report the filename and line number.
Your program's exit status should be 0
if there are no errors, and a nonzero number to indicate errors. For
lexical errors, use the exit status 1. For syntax errors, the exit status
should be 2.
<p>

If there are no errors, you should print a text representation of a syntax
tree.
<p>
Suppose we have a tree structure that looks something like:

<pre>
struct tree {
   int prodrule;
   int nkids;
   struct tree *kids[9];
   struct token *leaf;
}

int treeprint(struct tree *t, int depth)
{
  int i;

  printf("%*s %s: %d\n", depth*2, " ", humanreadable(t->prodrule), t->nkids);
  
  for(i=0; i&lt;t-&gt;nkids; i++)
    treeprint(t->kids[i], depth+1);

}
</pre>

you might get output that looks something like

<pre>
program: 1
 function: 2
  function header: 3
   typedecl: 1
   functioname: 1
   parmlist: 3
    ....

</pre>

For leaves, print out the integer code and the lexeme (yytext[]) for the
token, if any.
