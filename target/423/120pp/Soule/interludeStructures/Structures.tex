The next chapter introduces classes, which are an extended data structure.  A class combines data and functions that act on that data in one compound definition.  Classes are the foundational data structure of C++ and other object oriented languages.
However, the C programming language does not support classes, any program that depends on or uses classes cannot be a C program.  
Instead of classes C has a precursor to classes known as a \emph{structure}\index{structure} that is defined using the keyword \codefont{struct}\index{struct}.  C structures allow a programmer to group multiple data types into one compound data type.  They are commonly used in ``pure'' C programs, such as on microcontrollers, and are useful for simple data structures even in C++.

The basic format of a structure definition is:\\
\cf{
struct fraction\{\\
\hspace*{0.5cm} int numerator;\\
\hspace*{0.5cm} int denominator;\\
\}; \\}
This creates a new, compound type called \cf{struct fraction} that contains two \cf{ints}.

However, programmers find using the name \cf{struct fraction} awkward and so most structure definitions are actually written like:\\
\cf{
\textcolor{\mycolor}{typedef} struct fraction\{\\
\hspace*{0.5cm} int numerator;\\
\hspace*{0.5cm} int denominator;\\
\} \textcolor{\mycolor}{fraction}; \\}
Note the keyword \cf{typedef} at the beginning and the extra \cf{fraction} at the end of the structure declaration.  This redefines the type \cf{struct fraction} with the new name \cf{fraction}.\footnote{The \cf{typedef} command can be used to rename any type, for example \cf{typedef int bob;} renames the type \cf{int} as \cf{bob}.  However, there are only a few places that \cf{typedef} is frequently used, dropping the \cf{struct} from structure names is one of them.}

Now there is a \cf{fraction} type:\\
\cf{fraction f1, x, my\_fraction;}\\
declares three new variables of type \cf{fraction}.

Each of these new variables is a compound variable containing two integers.  To access the data the \emph{dot notation} is used.  For example, the commands:\\
\cf{f1.numerator = 1;\\
f1.denominator = 2;\\
}
makes the variable \cf{f1} effectively store the number 1/2.  

Similarly, printing a structure requires printing each piece of data explicitly.  for example the command: \\
\cf{
cout $<<$ f1.numerator $<<$ "/" $<<$ f1.denominator;
}\\
will print \emph{1/2}.


Functions can be written that both accept structures as arguments and return structures.  For example:\\
\codefont{fraction add(fraction, fraction)}\\
Defines a function called \cf{add()} that takes two \cf{fraction} structures as arguments and returns a \cf{fraction} structure.  Presumably, the function adds the two fractions together, but that is determined by how the function is coded.

Like most programming constructs, structures can be nested, can contain other data types, and can contain a mixture of types.  For example, in program for a fantasy game the programmer might create a structure for holding data about a player's character:\\
\cf{
typedef struct character\{\\
\hspace*{0.5cm} char[100] name;  \hspace*{1.3cm}  // character's name\\
\hspace*{0.5cm} int maxhealth;     \hspace*{1.4cm}  // maximum health\\
\hspace*{0.5cm} int currenthealth; \hspace*{0.55cm}  // current health\\
\hspace*{0.5cm} weapon currentweapon;\hspace*{0.1cm} // another structure holding weapon information\\
\hspace*{0.5cm} float armorvalue; \hspace*{0.85cm}// current armor value \\
\} character;\\
}
Now all of the information about a player's character can be stored in one variable.

Careful use of structures can greatly simplify a complex program by grouping data together.  For example, if you find yourself creating multiple functions that all have the same long parameter list it's may be a good idea to create a single structure to hold all of the data.  Then the functions can be rewritten to have one a single parameter whose type is the new structure.
