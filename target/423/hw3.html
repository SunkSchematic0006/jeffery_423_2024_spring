<h3> CSE 423 HW#3: a Parser </h3>

Due: Friday February 23 11:59pm.
<ul>
<li> Turnin on canvas a .zip file named hw3.zip.
<li> The .zip should unpack in the current directory, include
     a makefile and all files necessary to compile to executable.
<li> The compile should be free of warnings, other than shift/reduce
conflicts.
<li> Your makefile must use -Wall option for all GCC compiles
<li> Do not leave yydebug/YYDEBUG turned on.  Do not leave any spurious
     or debugging output in your submitted version. 
<li> Execution should be <u>valgrind-clean</u>, meaning no illegal memory reads
     or writes, and no use of uninitialized variables.
</ul>
<p>


Write or adapt a Rust(-subset) grammar.
The recommended starting point is
<ul>
<li> This <A href="http://www.cs.nmt.edu/~jeffery/irony/rustgram.y">grammar</A>
<!--<li> This <A href="http://www.cs.nmt.edu/~jeffery/puny/Grammar.html">Python grammar</A> from the Python language implementation.
<li> <A href="j0gram.y">j0gram.y</A>
 <li> The 120++ reference implementation mods of
      files originally distributed by Sandro Sigala:
     <A href="120pp/120gram.y">120gram.y</A>,
     <A href="120pp/120lex.l">120lex.l</A>,
and
     <A href="120pp/Makefile">Makefile</A>
     <A href="g0gram.y">g0gram.y</A>,
     <A href="go.y">go.y</A>, adapted from version 1.2.2 of the Go compiler,
     along with your lexical analyzer.  I will eventually finish a
     <A href="go.l">go.l</A> reference lexical analyzer; it is still under
     construction.  Similarly, you have to produce an adaptation of
     this <A href="makefile.vgo.hw2">Makefile</A> to work with Bison
     for this homework.
-->
</ul>
You will have to produce it into a .y file that works with Bison, and use it
to produce a <em>syntax tree</em> for input Irony source files.
<p>

To the extent that you modify the grammar, you are advised to ignore/allow
any number of shift/reduce conflicts unless you have an example where they
result in an error. Do <b>not</b> tolerate any reduce/reduce
conflicts -- they generally require grammar changes such as refactoring
common sequences within two or more production rules. Whichever
grammar/parser you use, you are responsible
for making it work for you and for any bugs. You may write
your own grammar from scratch if you prefer that over adapting
someone else's grammar.

<p>
Your parser should include at least the following:
<ul>
<li> To use your flex homework, rename terminal symbols from
     your flex file or from the grammar (.y file), or vice-versa,
     so that the Flex and Bison specifications use the same names/#defines.
<li> Add terminal symbols required by the .y file, possibly adapting missing
     symbols' regular expressions from your .l file. Note that in some
     years in this course the provided .y file uses character literals
     (whose integer codes are the same as their ASCII value)
     as the terminal symbols  for single-character operators and punctuation
     symbols. If so, your lexer has to return these integers (usually
     printable characters between 32 and 128) for these terminal symbols.
<!--
<li> Resolve matters regarding type names (for example, the names of classes)
     and the need to return
     different terminal symbol codes for "identifier" regular expressions,
     depending on syntactic context.
-->
<li> For every production rule in the grammar:
<ul>
<li> if the right hand side has &gt; 1 children, add a semantic action to
     construct a construct a tree node and assign $$ to point at it
<li> if the right hand side
     has 0 or 1 children, add a semantic action to set $$ to NULL
     (0 children) or to the child if there is 1 child ($$ = $1).
</ul>
<li> Place a pointer to your token in a yylval field on each call to yylex(),
     and ensure that those tokens get inserted as leaves into your syntax
     tree.
<li> If the parse succeeds, assign the root of the tree to a global variable
     from the semantic action associated with your start symbol.
<li> Revise the main() procedure from the Flex homework to call yyparse()
     and use the yyparse()
return value and/or global variables to ascertain whether the parse succeeded.
<li> If the parse succeeded, traverse/print your syntax tree as described below.
</ul>

<p>

If there is a syntax error, you should report the filename and line number.
Your program's exit status should be 0
if there are no errors, and a nonzero number to indicate errors. For
lexical errors, use the exit status 1. For syntax errors, the exit status
should be 2.
<p>

If there are no errors, you should print a text representation of a syntax
tree.
<p>
Suppose we have a tree structure that looks something like:

<pre>
struct tree {
   int prodrule;
   char *symbolname;
   int nkids;
   struct tree *kids[9]; /* if nkids &gt;0 */
   struct token *leaf;   /* if nkids == 0; might be null */
};

int treeprint(struct tree *t, int depth)
{
  int i;

  printf("%*s %s: %d\n", depth*2, " ", humanreadable(t), t->nkids);
  
  for(i=0; i&lt;t-&gt;nkids; i++)
    treeprint(t->kids[i], depth+1);

}
</pre>

If you write a function humanreadable(t) that returns a human readable string,
either from the production rule # or the optional symbolname,
you can get output that looks something like

<pre>
program: 1
 function: 2
  function header: 3
   typedecl: 1
   functioname: 1
   parmlist: 3
    ....

</pre>

For leaves, print out the integer code and the lexeme (yytext[]) for the
token, if any.
