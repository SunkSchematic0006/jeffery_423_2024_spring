<h3> CS 445 HW#4 </h3>

Due: Monday October 31 11:30am
<p>


Perform semantic analysis for EctoScript.  This shall consist of the
following items. Please turnin cscheckin electronic copy of your whole
project in a .tar but turnin paper copy only for those modules involved
in the semantic analysis, including symbol tables and type checking.

<dl>
<dt> Symbol tables
<dd> Build a symbol table data type that you can instantiate for each
     scope: packages, classes, methods.  For each symbol, you should
     enter a symbol table entry, a struct consisting of enough information
     to support the semantic analysis. Typically this will include symbol
     name, reference to which scope (parent symbol table) the symbol is
     defined in, declared data type, and any auxiliary flags, e.g. const.
     It is recommended that you implement a hash table, but a binary tree
     would work great; a linked list would work but not be so great.
<dt> Variable declarations
<dd> You must emit an error if a variable is redeclared in the same scope.
     You must detect and report an error for undeclared variables.
      * EctoScript is allowed to require variable declarations to occur prior
       to their use in a given source file.
     You must emit an error if a const variable is assigned other than in its
      initializer.
<dt> Types
<dd> EctoScript supports the standard built-in types, and classes.
     Built-in types include int, void, Boolean, String, Number, uint, Null,
         Object
<dt> Type Checking
<dd> EctoScript supports only the "strict" subset,
     in which types are required and checked everywhere at compile-time.
     You may choose to support the "standard dialect", but if so you will
     have to implement runtime type checking. The "strict" mode entails:
<ul>
<Li>    Check that function call signatures match
<Li>    Report expressions with incompatible types
<Li>    +++ Report duplicate definition conflicts
<Li>    +++ Report unbound references
<Li>    +++ Unfound packages
<Li>    *** Report dynamic addition of properties on sealed objects
<Li>    *** Report writing to const variables
<Li>    *** Report code that deletes fixed properties
</ul>
<dt> Functions
<dd> Functions don't have to be methods (inside classes) in ActionScript.
     Think: like C++.
<dt> Classes
<dd> Enjoy the classes in your object-oriented language.
     Inheritance is not required and would be "extra credit".
<dt> Interfaces
<dd> EctoScript does not bother with interfaces.  Lucky you!
<dt> "final"
<dd> EctoScript does not need "final" classes and methods.
<dt> "dynamic"
<dd> EctoScript does not care for "dynamic" or unsealed classes
<dt> "static"
<dd> EctoScript does not cow to "static" imperialist pig-dogs
<dt> qualified references
<dd> EctoScript disrespects and utterly neglects :: in object and package references.
<dt> Packages
<dd> it is pretty hard to get away from packages in Java-based languages.
     But there are too many cans of worms here.
     You should implement user-defined packages that contain classes,
     functions, variables and constants.
     What we said in class was: an import is never really a whole package,
     it is always one class (one .as file) from within a "package" where a
     package is just a directory structure.
<dt> Built-in Functions!
<dd> Without importing, we will implement the following "built-in" functions:
<pre> trace(s)
</pre> which is equivalent to printf("%s\n" ,s) and
<pre> String read()
</pre>
which is somewhat similar to gets(), returning one line of text input.

<p>

Notes:
<ul>
<li> your executable should be named "ec"
<li> your program should accept and process an arbitrary
	number of source filenames on the command line
<li> write out the name of the file to standard out when you open it
<li> do NOT write out the tree, or other debugging information, by default;
     you may add command line options to print that info if you want.
<li> error messages should be written to <em>standard error</em> not stdout
<li> if ANY file has a lexical error,
     your process exit status should return -1,
     for a syntax error -2, for a semantic error -3, and for no errors,
     return 0.
</ul>
