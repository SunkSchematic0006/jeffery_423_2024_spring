<h3> CS 445 HW#6 </h3>

Due: Friday December 16 12:00pm -- noon
<p>


Generate final code for EctoScript.
Please turnin cscheckin electronic copy of your whole
project in a hw6.tar but turnin paper copy only for those modules involved
in the code generation.


Take your EctoScript compiler, and add target code generation for some real
non-ActionScript platform language.
Options include: 
<ul>
<li> TAC-C: generate out C code with no more than 3 addresses per statement.
<li> x86_32 or x86_64 assembler code
<li> JVM or .Net, e.g. via the "jasmin" JVM assembler.
</ul>
<p>

To answer questions not covered in the manual, you can ask the instructor
or TA, or better yet, use "gcc -S" to look at what assembler code it
generates.


<p>

Finals week demos: you are strongly encouraged to demonstrate your compiler
to your professor in its final state.  This allows you to show what works
and ensures that you get credit for as much as you are able to accomplish.

<H3>Example</h3>


For an input file foo.as containing source code:
<p>
<table border>
<tr><td>
<pre>
package {
void public function main() { trace(String(10+2)); }
}
</table>
<p>

your output should look something like that below.

<pre>

</pre>

<h4> Notes </h4>
<ul>
<li> your executable should still be named "ec"
<li> your program should accept and process an arbitrary
	number of source filenames on the command line
<li> take in files with .as extensions and write out corresponding
     final code in files with an appropriate (e.g. .s or .c) extension.
<li> write out the name of the file to standard out when you open it
<li> do NOT write out the tree, or other debugging information, by default;
     you may add command line options to print that info if you want.
<li> error messages should be written to <em>standard error</em> not stdout
<li> If no errors and -c was given, call an assembler or compiler to produce
     an object code file in your target language.
<li> If no errors and no -c was given, go ahead and call a linker and
     produce an executable
<li> if ANY file has a lexical error,
     your process exit status should return -1,
     for a syntax error -2, for a semantic error -3, and for no errors,
     return 0.
</ul>
