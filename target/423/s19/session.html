<dt> How to connect from main() procedure in a .c file separate from flex file?
     Like use extern or what?
<dd> Yup, please get used to separate compilation. Use extern for globals in
     another file. Use prototype (with or without extern) for functions.
     Maybe put those in a .h file and include it, one .h per .c you link to.

<dt> Do we need a list reserved word or not?
<dd> Yes, sure. Actually I waffle, it could be a special identifier or a
     separate reserved word. But why not.

<dt> What specific options should we be passing to C++.
<dd> -Wall -g

<dt> Compiler jokes?
