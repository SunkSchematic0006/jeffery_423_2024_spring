<h2> CSE 423 Lab #5: Drawing Syntax Trees </h2>

Turnin:
<ol>
<li> a hand-drawn syntax tree sheet due Friday 2/23 3pm start of class,
and
<li>
 a pretty PNG image produced from your compiler on canvas,
due Friday 2/23, 11:59pm
</ol>
<p>

This week's lab asks you to practice drawing syntax trees by hand,
and then implement a tree traversal that generates
a graphical representation of your syntax trees or symbol tables.
Turn in as far as you get by Friday evening; preferably a .zip with some
sample images and your compiler code base that produced them. You will be
graded as
having done the lab as long as it looks like you did two or more
hours of work.

<p>

<h3>Part 1: Drawing Syntax Trees by Hand </h3>

You need a concrete mental model of the syntax trees
upon which the entire rest of the course will be built.  I will literally
ask you to draw syntax trees on the midterm and final exam, possibly with
aspects of semantic analysis or code generation to work out. So let's
practice drawing some syntax trees.

<ul>
<li>You will need a Rust grammar, such as <A href="rustgram.y.html">rustgram.y</A>
<li>Draw a circle or oval for each non-leaf node with two or more children.
<li>Draw a square or rectangle for each leaf node (token).
<li>Draw the non-terminal name inside circles/ovals, and the terminal symbol name inside squares/rectangles
<li> Draw lines connecting parents with children.
</ul>

<p>

<table><tr><td>
<pre>
fn main() {
    // Print text to the console.
    println!("Hello World!");
}
</pre>

<td>
<pre>
fn main() {
    // variable binding
    let x = 5;

    // expression;
    x;
    x + 1;
    15;
}
</pre>

<td>
<pre>
fn main() {
    let n = 5;

    if n < 0 {
        print!("{} is negative", n);
    } else if n > 0 {
        print!("{} is positive", n);
    } else {
        print!("{} is zero", n);
    }
}
</pre>

Check your work by exchanging with a classmate, or do Part 2 and compare your work against the Machine.



<h3> Part 2: Dot </h3>

Dot is part of a package called graphviz.  It is available for Linux and
Windows; maybe MacOS too.  On login.cs.nmt.edu it is in /usr/bin/dot
which should already be on your path.  If you want to do this lab on your
own machine, you will have to <A href="https://graphviz.org/download/">download
and install graphviz</A>.
<p>

The dot language is a human readable ASCII way of describing a graph,
which dot will then render in forms such as a PNG image file.

<p>
Here is
<A href="https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html">the dot language reference</A> 

<h4> Prepping your Dot Syntax Trees </h4>

To use Dot, each tree node will require a unique identification. While we could
maybe get away with using their address (pointer) as an id, you should probably
go ahead and add a new field to your tree structure (translate as needed to fit
your tree type):

<pre>
struct tree {
  ...
  int id;
  ...
}
</pre>

And initialize this field in <code>alctree()</code> or whatever
you are using to construct tree nodes (translate as needed):

<pre>
int serial;
struct tree *alctree(int label, char *sname, int nkids, ...)
{
   ...
   ptr->id = serial++;
   ...
}
</pre>

If you have additional functions that allocate tree nodes
(<code>alcleaf()</code> or whatever)
they should also add the code to initialize their id #.

<h4> Adding names for token categories </h4>

Dunno if you wrote your own means of printing token categories, but if
YYDEBUG is defined, Bison (maybe not other yacc's, or not compatibly) writes
out a static array of strings from which you can get token (and non-terminal)
names.

<pre>#if YYDEBUG || YYERROR_VERBOSE || 0
/* YYTNAME[SYMBOL-NUM] -- String name of the symbol SYMBOL-NUM.
   First, the terminals, then, starting at YYNTOKENS, nonterminals.  */
static const char *const yytname[] =
{
  "$end", "error", "$undefined", "BAD_TOKEN", "ICON", "CCON", "FCON",
  "ENUMERATION_CONSTANT", "IDENTIFIER", "STRING", "SIZEOF", "INCOP",
</pre>

You can't read this <b><code>static</code></b> array from other .c files,
but you can add the following to the end of your .y file:

<pre>%%

const char *yyname(int sym)
{
   return yytname[sym-BAD_TOKEN+3];
}
</pre>

If you are writing your compiler in a different language or using a
different YACC implementation you may have to adapt or build-your-own
substantially in order to perform the equivalent; feel free to ask for help
and/or share your results if you figure it out for another YACC
implementation.

<h4> Writing your Dot Syntax Trees </h4>

Write a <code>print_graph()</code> function that traverses your tree and
writes out a Dot file with extension <code>.dot</code>. You can base this
on your textual tree-printing function from HW#3, and just modify your
print statements to write things in Dot format.
<p>

Your solution might look some something like the following (adapted from
[Jeffery2021]).  You may have to debug this code!

<pre>

/* add a \ before leading and trailing double quotes */
char *escape(char *s) {
   char *s2 = malloc(strlen(s)+4);
   if (s[0] == '\"') {
      if (s[strlen(s)-1] != '\"') {
	 fprintf(stderr, "What is it?!\n");
	 }
      sprintf(s2, "\\%s", s);
      strcat(s2+strlen(s2)-1, "\\\"");
      return s2;
     }
   else return s;
}

char *pretty_print_name(struct tree *t) {
   char *s2 = malloc(40);
   if (t->leaf == NULL) {
      sprintf(s2, "%s#%d", t->symbolname, t->prodrule%10);
      return s2;
      }
   else {
      sprintf(s2,"%s:%d", escape(t->leaf->text), t->leaf->category);
      return s2;
      }
}

void print_branch(struct tree *t, FILE *f) {
   fprintf(f, "N%d [shape=box label=\"%s\"];\n", t->id, pretty_print_name(t));
}

char *yyname(int);

void print_leaf(struct tree *t, FILE *f) {
   char * s = yyname(t->leaf->category);
   // print_branch(t, f);
   fprintf(f, "N%d [shape=box style=dotted label=\" %s \\n ", t->id, s);
   fprintf(f, "text = %s \\l lineno = %d \\l\"];\n", escape(t->leaf->text),
   t->leaf->lineno);
}

void print_graph2(struct tree *t, FILE *f) {
   int i;
   if (t->leaf != NULL) {
      print_leaf(t, f);
      return;
      }
   /* not a leaf ==> internal node */
   print_branch(t, f);
   for(i=0; i &lt; t->nkids; i++) {
      if (t->kids[i] != NULL) {
         fprintf(f, "N%d -> N%d;\n", t->id, t->kids[i]->id);
	 print_graph2(t->kids[i], f);
	 }
      else { /* NULL kid, epsilon production or something */
         fprintf(f, "N%d -> N%d%d;\n", t->id, t->id, serial);
	 fprintf(f, "N%d%d [label=\"%s\"];\n", t->id, serial, "Empty rule");
	 serial++;
	 }
      }
}

void print_graph(struct tree *t, char *filename){
      FILE *f = fopen(filename, "w"); /* should check for NULL */
      fprintf(f, "digraph {\n");
      print_graph2(t, f);
      fprintf(f,"}\n");
      fclose(f);
}
</pre>

<h4> Adding a command line option</h4>

Modify your compiler to accept an optional argument <code>-dot</code> and if
you see that option, have your compiler call your .dot-file generating code
instead of its normal behavior.

<h4> Running the Dot Program  </h4>

Given a .dot file written by your compiler, in a file like hello.java.dot,
to generate a PNG image, you would invoke it via

<pre>
dot -Tpng hello.java.dot >hello.png
</pre>

View the generated image to make sure it looks understandable.  For example,
for a C subset language, a hello world program (<A href="hello.c">hello.c</A>)
results in the following:
<p>
<img src="hello.png">
<p>

Of course, for some other language, your tree should look different.

<h4> Wrapping up </h4>

Try your .dot-file generation on the following program:

<pre>
// foo.rs
fn foo(x : i64, y : String) -> i64 {
   return x;
   }
fn main() {
   let z : i64;
   z = foo(5, ("funf").to_string());
}
</pre>

<!--
# foo.py
def foo(x : int, y : str) -> int :
     return x

z : int
z = foo(5, "funf")
-->

<!--
<pre>
public class foo {
   public static int foo(int x, String y) {
      return x;
     }

   public static int main()
  {
   int z;
   z = foo(5, "funf");
   return 0;
   }
}
</pre>
-->

For this program, you might be running
<!--
<pre>
./j0 -dot foo.java
dot -Tpng foo.java.dot >foo.png
</pre>
<pre>
./puny -dot foo.py
dot -Tpng foo.py.dot >foo.png
</pre>
-->
<pre>
./fec -dot foo.rs
dot -Tpng foo.rs.dot >foo.png
</pre>


When foo.png looks reasonable,
you are done with the lab. Submit your image on canvas.
