<h3> CS 423 HW#6 </h3>

Due: Wednesday May 3 5:00pm, end of last day of instruction
<p>


Generate executable PunY programs.  Please turnin via Canvas
an electronic copy of your whole project in a hw6.zip.
<p>

There are two main options, illustrated in <A href="107-ucode/">these examples.</A>


<h3> The Transpiler Option </h3>

In this option, after type checking, your job is to traverse your tree
and generate out Unicon source code, which you then compile and link
with a PunY runtime system to produce a VM executable. Unicon is quite
similar to Python and lives at
<A href="http://unicon.org">unicon.org</A>. If you take this (easier) option,
more complete PunY functionality is expected for a given letter grade.
Implement all the PunY features including lists and dicts and the runtime
system needed, with the exception of the turtle module, which is
"aspirational".


<h3> The Intermediate-to-Ucode Option </h3>

In this option, after type checking, your job is to traverse your tree
reduce complex expressions down to a longer number of simple expressions
(commonly called intermediate code), and write out Unicon assembler code
(so-called ucode), which you then assemble and link with a PunY runtime
system to produce a VM executable.


<ul>
<li> Create a struct for working with lists of "Ucode 3-address instructions".
     Define integers for each opcode.  Implement operations to create
     a new list with one instruction, and list concatenation.
<li> Include separate instructions/opcodes for each operator.
<li> Include instructions/opcodes for required type conversions.
<li> Define a data type for "memory address". A memory address is a
     &lt;region,offset&gt; pair, where region is one of GLOBAL, STRUCT,
     PARAM, LOCAL, CONST, or IMMED.  Offsets start with 0 in each region,
     and are numbered as slots/indices capable of holding one value.
     You can define more regions if you wish.
<li> Write out "declarations" (pseudocode instructions) for functions.
<li> For each variable in each symbol table, assign it a "memory address"
     consisting of integer slot/index with the region.
<li> Compute a synthesized attribute "location" (or .place)
     for every expression.
<li> Allocate a "temporary variable" out of the LOCAL region for each
     value computed by an operator or function invocation.
<li> Compute a synthesized attribute "code" that builds
     a link list of 3-address instructions that compute a value
     for each expression.
</ul>

Output from this phase should consist of a file containing intermediate
code instructions.  It should contain a .string region for string constants,
a .global region for global variables, and a .code region for instructions.
If the input was foo.py, the output file should be
named foo.uic ("Unicon intermediate code").  Output should always be written to
the current directory, so if the input was /usr/local/temp/foo.py the
output would still just be named foo.uic.

<p>
Example.
<p>

For an input file foo.{c,go,java,py} containing source code:
<p>
<table border>
<tr> <th> Python <!-- <th> C <th> Go <th> Java -->
<tr><td>
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main() { printf("%d\n", 10+2); return 0;}
</pre>
<td>
<pre>
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
   fmt.Println(10+2)
}
<!--int main() { printf("%d\n", 10+2); return 0;}-->
</pre>
<td>
<pre>
public class foo {
public static void main(String[]argv) {
   System.out.println((10+2)+"");
   }
</pre>
<td>
<pre>
def main():
   print(10+2)
</pre>
</table>
<p>

your output should look something like that below.
loc: is the local region
(offset from base pointer). const: is immediate mode (numeric constants).
string: is an offset into a string constant region (global, read-only).
Your output does <b>not</b> need to include the interpretation column,
just the output column.  "interpretation" here is just my explanation
to you. However, if your three address code does not look something like this,
I may require you to hand-annotate it with interpretation so I can read it.
<p>

<h3> Yet Another Option </h3>

If you completely reject my primary requirement of running Python programs
on the Unicon virtual machine, but you write a compiler that lets Python
programs run on another platform (besides Python) on login.cs.nmt.edu, you
can still complete the semester project successfully. For example, if you
generate x86_64, either directly/natively or via LLVM, fine.


<h3> Notes </h3>
<ul>
<li> your executable should still be named puny
<li> take in files with .py extensions
and write out an executable that I can run on login.cs.nmt.edu.
<li> For partial credit you could write
     intermediate code in files with a .uic (intermediate code) extension,
     using the filename conventions described above.
<li> write out the name of the file to standard out when you open it
<li> do NOT write out the tree, or other debugging information, by default;
     you may add command line options to print that info if you want.
<li> error messages should be written to <em>standard error</em> not stdout
<li> if ANY file has a lexical error,
     your process exit status should return 1,
     for a syntax error 2, for a semantic error 3, and for no errors,
     return 0.
</ul>
