    fret is our user input, and chord is every character in a file, split into a list. A while 
    loop on value i is run to see if the characters in one phrase are identical to another. If they match,
    the j value is increased. If the whole phrase matches, a print statement is shown, describing where the 
    match is. B keeps track of the character position in the line. Once the loop is finished, the fuction
    uses recursion to call itself starting on the second character and moving the character up.
    C keeps track of the line. Every time a \ n character is encountered, b is reset to zero, and c is moved to
    1. k is the negative result tracker. If a positive match is found, k is moved up to the positives every 
    time the function is recalled. If no matches are found, a print statement will be issued stating that
    the searched string is not found in the file. """
