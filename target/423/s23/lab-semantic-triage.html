<h2> CSE 423 Lab #10: Semantic Analysis Triage </h2>

Turnin: no turnin, your HW#5 is your turnin
<p>

This week's lab will be completely free-form, the time will be spent just
helping out anyone who needs help with HW#5 and is willing to share their
screen with the class.  If you are done with HW#5, you are not required
to attend.

<p>

If you don't have questions for the instructor, I will kick around various
thoughts on type checking and the like.
<p>

What would it take to modify the output we write for dot, so that we could
see the type information along with our syntax trees?  Would it even be
legible?
<ul>
<li> have type representation linked into executable -- CHECK
<li> actually build type information declarations -- part of your HW5
<li> get type information printable textually, before worrying about
printing it in dot.
<li> Print the type's basetype in the node directly?
<li> Include the type structure only when not an atomic type?
<li> modify print_leaf to print type information for leaves
<ul>
<li> modify print_leaf to print type information for constants
</ul>
<li> modify print_branch to print type information for internal nodes
</ul>
