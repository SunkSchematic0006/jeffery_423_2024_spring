Homework Assignment 1: Learn Some Rust

<p>

Due: Monday January 22, 3:00pm (firm deadline)<p>

This first assignment is intended to be casual.
It must completed and turned in successfully on Canvas.
Turn in this HW as an online document submission in PDF format.

<p>

1. Go get a rust compiler, install it on a machine on which you plan
to do your 423 project work. In Canvas, your answer for #1 should
include what rust compiler you obtained and from where, along with
any installation issues, problems, or obstacles you see with it.
Hint: I downloaded something called Rustup and it ran for awhile.

<p>

2. Go read a Rust tutorial, or manual, or book, or watch Rust videos.  You
may wish to start at <A href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">
https://www.rust-lang.org/</A> or let Mr. Google find things for you.
Reading/doing "Rust By Example" may be useful. Do
whatever you need to in order to get comfortable with Rust.  By Rust, I mean
the Rust programming language, not the Rust video game. In Canvas for your
answer #2 you should submit a sample Rust hello world program.

<p>

3. Verify that Rust is working for you by running your hello world
program. Debug as needed. Submit the command line to run the rust
compiler and the command line to run the resulting executable.

<p>

4. Do not settle for just Hello World.  Actually spend a few hours
learning what Rust you can.
Write a one-page summary of how Rust compares to C and/or Python,
and what you think will be the primary challenges in writing a
translator for Rust this semester, aside from learning
some more Rust that is.
