<h3>CS 445 Assignment 1: Requirements Analysis. Jzero, or PunY?</h3>

Due: Tuesday January 25, 11:59pm<p>

In this assignment you will propose a definition of a subset variant of
either the Java or Python programming language.  You may work alone or
in teams.  Part of the goal is "voting with your feet" in the sense that
the number and quality of HW#1's turned in may decide for me which
language we all will be implementing this semester.  You should propose
whichever language you would prefer to develop a compiler for
between now and May.

<p>

<h3> How much Java (or Python) do you Know? </h3>

You may need a refresher, or you may need to do a quick study of Java
(or Python) essentials.

<h3> What is Jzero?  What is PunY? </h3>

These are the (tiny) subsets of the respective languages that would be
covered in a first course of 3-4 semester credits in a university.
You must meet some minimum criterion spelled out below, but then you can
propose which features of the language are essential.

<h3> Language Details </h3>

Your definition of the <code>Jzero</code> or <code>PunY</code> language
should be described
in a legal HTML5 or PDF document styled after this <A href="c113c.html">
C subset</A>. You are proposing a definition for what you are going
to implement. The class's eventual official definition will be derived
by joint agreement, with non-consensus points decided by the instructor.

<h3> Requirements </h3>

<h4> Common Requirements </h4>

<ul>
<li> integers and strings
<li> if and while statements
<li> functions and parameters
<li> must generate code for a readable assembler-style instruction set
      that will run on lovecraft.cs.nmt.edu (for grading purposes).
      Examples: x86_64, JVM via jasmin, Unicon ucode, or roll your own...
<li> you may use 3rd party tools for assembly, linking
<li> you may use 3rd party libraries called from your generated code
</ul>

<h4> Java Requirements </h4>

<ul>
<li> Your Jzero definition should be consistent with (i.e. a superset of)
     that described in "Build Your Own Programming Language".
</ul>

<h4> Python Requirements </h4>

<ul>
<li> Subset of Python 3.7+
<li> Require variable declarations
<li> Require type "hints" for variables, parameters, return types
</ul>

<h3> Turn in... </h3>

An electronic copy via Canvas.  The electronic copy should be a
PDF or .docx file.
