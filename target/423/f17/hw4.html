<h3> CS 445 HW#4 </h3>

Due: Friday November 3 11:59pm
<p>

Perform the rest of semantic analysis for 120++.  This shall consist
of the following items. Please turnin via bblearn an electronic copy of your
whole project in a .zip. Please create your .zip file in such a way that it
unpacks into the current directory, rather than a subdirectory.
<p>

<font color=red>New: add -Wall</font> to your makefile compile rules,
and for maximum credit, turn in a solution that compiles with no warnings
when -Wall warnings have been turned on.


<dl>
<dt> Types
<dd> Support the CS 120 C++ base types: char, int, double, and void.
     Support 1D arrays, pointer to char, and simple classes
     (120++ supports a small subset of C++ classes).

<dt> Type Checking
<dd> Require and check types everywhere at compile-time.
<ul>
<Li>    Check that function call signatures match
<Li>    Check that operators' operands are compatible
</ul>
<dt> Operators
<dd> The semantic rules for operators are all nearly the same; at the
     semantic analysis phase we will support those actually used in CS 120,
     not everything mentioned in passing with no use in an example program.
     This includes the operators =, +, -, *, /, and subscript ([ ]).
     Support the boolean/relational operators &lt, &gt; &amp;&amp; || and !.

<dt> Built-in Classes
<dd> If the appropriate include file and "using namespace" are present, you
     should insert into the global symbol table the names of classes
     string and fstream, and the global symbols cin, cout, endl.

<dt> Nesting
<dd> Expressions will generally get combined to form larger expressions.
     In the object-oriented realm, 120++ includes expressions such as
     the following
<pre>
     o1.f(o2.g())
     a[i].m()
     (h->g())->i() == n
</pre>
     However, x.y.z might never occur because 120++ does not require
     public member variables.
</dl>

<p>

Notes:
<ul>
<li> your executable should be named "120++"

<li> your program should accept and process an arbitrary
	number of source filenames on the command line
<li> write out the name of the file to standard out when you open it
<li> do NOT write out the tree, or other debugging information, by default;
     you may add command line options to print that info if you want.
<li> error messages should be written to <em>standard error</em> not stdout
<li> if ANY file has a lexical error,
     your process exit status should return 1,
     for a syntax error 2, for a semantic error 3, and for no errors,
     return 0.

</ul>
