<h3> CS 445 HW#3 </h3>

Due: Sunday October 15 11:59pm
<p>


Perform the first part of semantic analysis for 120++.  This shall consist
of the following items. Please turnin via bblearn an electronic copy of your
whole project in a .zip. Please create your .zip file in such a way that it
unpacks into the current directory, rather than a subdirectory.

<dl>
<dt> Symbol tables
<dd> Build a symbol table data type that you can instantiate for each scope:
     one global scope, one scope per class for member variables and functions,
     and one scope per function for parameters and locals.  You do not have
     to support nested local scopes via a separate symbol table.  120++ does
     have symbols declared as statements spread through the statement list,
     and symbols declared as control variables in for-loops.
     For each symbol, you should insert a symbol table entry, which is
     a struct consisting of enough information
     to support the semantic analysis. Typically this will include symbol
     name, reference to which scope (containing symbol table) the symbol is
     defined in, declared data type (required in the next homework), and any
     auxiliary flags, e.g. const.
     For full credit, implement a hash table;  a binary tree would be a
     fine alternative (90% credit); a linked list would work but not be
     so great (80% credit).
<dt> Variable declarations
<dd> You must emit an error if a variable is redeclared in the same scope.
     You must detect and report an error for undeclared variables.
<dt> Exclusions
<dd> This is another phase at which you can emit semantic errors for anything
     not supported in 120++. Feel free to ask me specifics about anything you
     are unsure of.
<!--
<dt> Types
<dd> Support the CS 120 C++ base types: char, int, and void.
     Support 1D arrays, and simple classes.

<dt> Type Checking
<dd> Require and check types everywhere at compile-time.
<ul>
<Li>    Check that function call signatures match
<Li>    Check that operators' operands are compatible
</ul>
<dt> Operators
<dd> The semantic rules for operators are all nearly the same; at the
     semantic analysis phase we will support those actually used in CS 120,
     not everything mentioned in passing with no use in an example program.
     This includes the operators =, +, -, *, /, and subscript ([ ]).
     Support the boolean/relational operators &lt, &gt; &amp;&amp; || and !.

<dt> Built-in Classes
<dd> If the appropriate include file and "using namespace" are present, you
     should insert into the global symbol table the names of classes
     string and fstream, and the global symbols cin, cout, endl.

<dt> Nesting
<dd> Expressions will generally get combined to form larger expressions.
     In the object-oriented realm, 120++ includes expressions such as
     the following
<pre>
     o1.f(o2.g())
     a[i].m()
     (h->g())->i() == n
</pre>
     However, x.y.z might never occur because 120++ does not require
     public member variables.

</dl>

<p>

Notes:
<ul>
<li> your executable should be named "120++"

<li> your program should accept and process an arbitrary
	number of source filenames on the command line
<li> write out the name of the file to standard out when you open it
<li> do NOT write out the tree, or other debugging information, by default;
     you may add command line options to print that info if you want.
<li> error messages should be written to <em>standard error</em> not stdout
<li> if ANY file has a lexical error,
     your process exit status should return 1,
     for a syntax error 2, for a semantic error 3, and for no errors,
     return 0.

</ul>
