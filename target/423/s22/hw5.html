<h3> CS 423 HW#5 </h3>

Due: Thursday April 7 11:59pm
<p>

Perform the rest of semantic analysis for j0.  This shall consist
of the following items. Please turnin via Canvas an electronic copy of your
whole project in a .zip. Please create your .zip file in such a way that it
unpacks into the current directory, rather than a subdirectory.
<p>

Note: if you haven't already, add -Wall to your makefile compile rules,
and for maximum credit, turn in a solution that compiles with no warnings
when -Wall warnings have been turned on.


<dl>
<dt> Types
<dd> Support the j0 base types.
     Support 1D-arrays, classes* and methods*,
     including j0's subset of the String class.

<dt> Type Checking
<dd> Require and check types everywhere at compile-time.
<ul>
<Li>    Check that method call signatures match method declarations
<Li>    Check that operators' operands are compatible
</ul>
<dt> Operators
<dd> The semantic rules for operators are all nearly the same; at the
     semantic analysis phase we will support at least
     the operators =, +, -, *, /, subscript ([ ]) and dot ( . ).
     Support the boolean/relational operators &lt, &gt; &amp;&amp; || and !.

<dt> Built-ins
<dd> You should insert into the symbol tables the names of
     built-in j0 class library objects and methods.

<dt> Nesting
<dd> Expressions will generally get combined to form larger expressions.
     This includes nested calls as parameters to other calls, chains of
     dot operators for structs, etc.
</dl>

<p>

Notes:
<ul>
<li> your executable should be named "j0"

<!--
<li> your program should accept and process an arbitrary
	number of source filenames on the command line, treating
        them as one big program with a shared global name space.
-->
<li> write out the name of the source file to standard out when you open it
<li> do NOT write out the tree, or other debugging information, by default;
     you may add command line options to print that info if you want.
<li> error messages should be written to <em>standard error</em> not stdout
<li> if ANY file has a lexical error,
     your process exit status should return 1,
     for a syntax error 2, for a semantic error 3, and for no errors,
     return 0.

</ul>
