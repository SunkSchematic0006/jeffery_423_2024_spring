Students will be using a web-based Java tutorial system developed by a team
at NMT. The study should take no longer than 50 minutes to complete and will
consist of asking each student to sign a consent form (they are not required
to sign the form if they do not wish to participate in the study), fill out
a brief entry survey, use the system, and fill out an exit survey.
