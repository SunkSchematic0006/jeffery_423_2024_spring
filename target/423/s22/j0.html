<h2><A NAME="Introduction">1. Introduction</A></h2>

<code>j0</code> is a family of subsets of Java.
Broadly, <code>j0</code> is intended to correspond roughly to
the subset of Java that would be covered in a CS1 class,
or in NMT's case, the CSE 213 course.
The facilities that j0 supports are interesting
enough to write some non-trivial computations in it.
How much of j0 you must implement depends on your team size:
<ul>
<li> teams of size 1 should implement j0.1 (Jzero Level One)
<li> teams of size 2 should implement j0.2 (Jzero Level Two)
<li> teams of size 3 should implement j0.3 (Jzero Level Three)
</ul>

<p>
j0 programs are legal Java programs with a .java file extension.
A program consists of a class that contains
a <code>main()</code> procedure where execution starts.
A "Hello world" program looks like:

<pre>
public class HelloWorld {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Hello, World");
   }
}
</pre>

The Java import facility is restricted to only those built-in system
imports used in CSE 213, which are faked in j0.

<p>

Java features many basic types.
j0 supports:

<pre>
char
int
float
boolean
String
</pre>

<p>

The types <code>int</code> and <code>float</code> both refer to 64-bit values.
The types <code>short</code>, <code>long</code>, and <code>double</code> are
allowed in j0 and denote aliases for <code>int</code> and <code>float</code>.
Booleans and chars are stored in a single byte (like C, rather than Java
16-bit characters)

<p>
  
  j0 has <code>while</code> and <code>for</code> loops.
  Curly braces around the loop body are required.
  For loops require non-empty expressions for all three parts of the header.
  For loop clauses do not allow variable declaration in the initializer,
  nor use of the comma operator to initialize or update multiple variables
  each iteration.
  In j0.1 for loop headers may ONLY consist of an assignment to a variable,
  a boolean test of that variable, and an increment/decrement/assignment of
  that variable.  In j0.2+ the second and third parts of a for-loop are
  expressions constrained to produce boolean and integer values.

<p>

Conditionals in j0 consist of if statements. j0.2+ has switch statements.
If statements use syntax similar to while loops. Curly braces are required.
An <code>else</code> branch is optional.


<pre>
if (x &lt; 0) {
   ...
}
</pre>

<code>else</code> branches require curly braces, unless they are (chained) if statements.

<pre>
if (x &lt; 0) {
   ...
} else if (x &lt; 10) {
   ...
} else {
   ...
}
</pre>

<p>
  j0.2+ supports switch statements.
  Switch statements in j0 require constant, non-duplicate switch cases.
  A break is
  required at the end of each pre-final, non-empty chunk of code
  (no fall-through).
  A default clause is required at the end, with no break.


  <pre>
    switch (c) {
    case 1: case 2:
       printf("1 or 2\n"); break;
    case 3: case 4:
       printf("3 or 4\n"); break;
    default:
       printf("some other value\n");
    }
  </pre>


<p>
Java supports creation of new types via a class.
j0.1 does not have (user-defined) classes
j0.2+ has user-defined (simple) classes.
<p>

Java has no pointers; it has references. j0 should support enough
in terms of references to allow operations essential for Strings
and arrays.

<p>

Java has arrays, which are a weird built-in thing that are not class
instances and have special syntax support.
j0 has one-dimensional arrays only.

<p>

When in doubt about j0 features, refer to the Java language specification.
I will add notes below as needed.  The easiest way to get out of
having to implement something is to ask about it and negotiate.



<h3> 2. <A NAME="Lexical">Lexical Rules</A> </h3>

The lexical rules of j0 start with: the lexical rules of Java.
<code>j0</code>
may simplify and reduce the lexical rules of Java a bit.
<p>


<p>
<A NAME="Comments"></A><B><FONT SIZE=3>2.1 Whitespace and Comments</B></FONT>
<p>

Of the Java whitespace characters, j0 must implement space, tab, carriage
return, and newline.

<p>

  j0 supports both styles of Java comments.
  Comments may be text placed between the delimiters /* and */. They may
  not be nested.
  Comments can also use // to comment from that point to the end of a line.
  Examples:
  <pre> x = 1; //single line comment
    /* this is a
    multiple line
    comment */</pre>
  
<p>
<A NAME="Reserved"></A><B><FONT SIZE=3>2.2 Reserved Words</B></FONT>
<p>

  Java has many reserved words.
  The reserved words (also called keywords) in all of j0 are in bold.
  Those not in any j0 have strikethrough and
  should result in a fatal error ("this C feature is not in j0").
  Words with neither bold nor strikethrough are in Level Two or Level Three
  of j0.

<p>

Supported reserved words:
<b>boolean</b>, break, case, <b>char</b>, <b>class</b>, continue, default, <b>double</b>, <b>else</b>, <b>float</b>,
<b>for</b>, <b>if</b>, instanceof, <b>int</b>, <b>long</b>, new, <b>public</b>, <b>return</b>, <b>static</b>, switch, <b>void</b>,
<b>while</b>.

<p>

Java reserved words not in Jzero:
<s>abstract, assert, byte, catch, const, do, enum, exports, extends,
final, finally, goto, implements, import, interface, module, native,
package, protected, requires, short, strictfp, super, synchronized,
this, throw, throws, transient, try, var, volatile, private</s>.

<p>


<p>
<A NAME="Operators"></A><B><FONT SIZE=3>2.3 Operators</B></FONT>
<p>

  j0 supports the following operators<p>
  
<table border>
  <tr> <td> = <td> assignment. j0.2+ includes +=, -=. </tr>
  <tr> <td> + - * / <td> binary arithmetic, int and float</tr>
  <tr> <td> % <td> binary arithmetic, int</tr>
  <tr> <td> ++ -- <td> unary increment and decrement, int only, suffix only</tr>
  <tr> <td> - <td> unary negation, prefix</tr>
  <tr> <td> == != &gt; &lt; &gt;= &lt;= <td> binary comparison</tr>
  <tr> <td> &amp;&amp; || ! <td> logical AND, OR, and NOT </tr>
  <tr> <td> instanceof <td> j0.3 includes instanceof </tr>
  <tr> <td> [ ] . <td> binary subscript and dot

  <tr> <td> (type) <td> j0.2+ does type casts </tr>
</table>

<p>

An error is reported for
<ul>
  <li> bitwise or shift operators
    ~, &lt;&lt;, &gt;&gtl; &amp;=, |=, ^=, &gt;&gt;=, &lt;&lt;=, &amp;, |, ^
<li> other augmented assignment operators
<li> ternary ?: operator
<li> reference operations
</ul>

The comma operator <code>,</code> is not in j0,
but the comma is legal punctuation in variable
declaration lists and function parameter lists.


<p>
<A NAME="Literals"></A><B><FONT SIZE=3>2.4 Literals</B></FONT>
<p>

<h4>Integers</h4>
<ul>
    <li> j0.1 only does decimal integer literals
    <li> j0.2+ does hexadecimal
    <li> j0.3 also does octal and binary
    <li> unsupported formats are recognized and reported as lexical errors
    <li> unsigned designation is a lexical error
   <li> long designation (L suffix) allowed and ignored since all ints are long
</ul>

   <h4>Reals</h4>

   <ul>
   <li> j0.1 does not have to do real numbers.
   <li> j0.2 only does simple real numbers involving
       one or more integers to the left or right (or both) of a decimal
   <li> j0.3 shall allow scientific/exponent
    <li> unsupported formats are recognized and reported as lexical errors
   <li> long designation (L suffix) allowed and ignored since all floats are
           doubles
   </ul>

   <h4> Characters </h4>

<ul>
  <li> j0 allows simple character literals consisting of a single character
       enclosed in apostrophes
  <li> the character may be a printable character from the keyboard, or an
       escape character, see below
  <li> j0 recognizes and reports an error for character literals with more
    than one character, e.g. 'abc'
</ul>

   <h4> Strings </h4>

<ul>
  <li> j0 allows simple string literals consisting of zero or more
       characters enclosed in double quotes
  <li> characters may be a printable character from the keyboard, or an
       escape character, see below
</ul>
 

<h4>Escape Sequences (Character and String Literals)</h4>

j0.1 supports \n, \t, \', \" <br>
j0.2 also supports \a, \f, \r, \0 octals <br>
j0.3 also supports \b, \v, \?, \x hexadecimals <br>
Unsupported escapes should be recognized and report a lexical error.
<p>

   <table><tr>
       <th>
Escape sequence<th>Hex value in ASCII<th>	Character represented
<tr><td>\a<td>	07<td>	Alert (Beep, Bell)
<tr><td>\b<td>	08<td>	Backspace
<tr><td>\f<td>	0C<td>	Formfeed Page Break
<tr><td>\n<td>	0A<td>	Newline (Line Feed); see notes below
<tr><td>\r<td>	0D<td>	Carriage Return
<tr><td>\t<td>	09<td>	Horizontal Tab
<tr><td>\v<td>	0B<td>	Vertical Tab
<tr><td>\\<td>	5C<td>	Backslash
<tr><td>\'<td>	27<td>	Apostrophe or single quotation mark
<tr><td>\"<td>	22<td>	Double quotation mark
<tr><td>\?<td>	3F<td>	Question mark (used to avoid trigraphs)
<tr><td>\nnn<td>any<td>	octal escapes
<tr><td>\xhh<td>any<td> hexadecimal escapes
<tr><td>\uhhhh<td>none<td> Unicode code points
</table>

   
<p>
<A NAME="Punctuation"></A><B><FONT SIZE=3>2.5 Punctuation</B></FONT>
<p>

  Punctuation characters are lexemes that are supported in j0 that are
  not part of other lexemes (not operators, not identifiers, not literals).

  <pre>
(  )  ,  ;  {  }  , :
  </pre>

  Other punctuation characters generally should be reported as lexical errors,
  including

  <pre>
#  $  @  \  `
  </pre>

  One exception: a line beginning with # in the following format is a
  line directive and is to be interpreted as per GCC. It gives a line number
  N and (quoted) filename to be used for reporting on the line(s) that follow.
  The ... is (optional) other stuff you can treat as a comment and ignore
  up until the next newline character.

  <pre>
# N "f" ...
  </pre>

<p>
<A NAME="Identifiers"></A><B><FONT SIZE=3>2.6 Identifiers</B></FONT>
<p>

Identifiers in j0 are as per the C language, not Java: a letter followed by
zero or more additional letters or digits. They are case-sensitive.

<h3> 3. <A NAME="Syntax">Syntax</A> </h3>

A good fraction of standard Java syntax will denote constructs that are not
supported in j0.
The easiest thing is probably to support the whole Java language grammar,
less the parts that have been ruled out via lexical errors, and then define
portions of it that will be unsupported and trigger an error in HW#3.

<p>
<A NAME="FunctionSyntax"></A><B><FONT SIZE=3>3.1 Function Syntax</B></FONT>
<p>

  Function definitions in j0 follow the following format. In j0.1 they are all
  static, with the static keyword required before the return type.
<pre>
<em>return type</em> identifier ( <em>parameter_list</em> ) { <em>function body</em> }
</pre>

  
<p>
<A NAME="ControlStructures"></A><B><FONT SIZE=3>3.2 Control Structures</B></FONT>
<p>

<pre>
if (statement) {}
if (statement) {} else {}
if (statement) {} else if (statement) {} else {}
while (statement) {}
for ( init; condition; increment) {}
switch(integer){
case literal:
statements;
...
default:
statements;
}
</pre>

  
<p>
<A NAME="Classes"></A><B><FONT SIZE=3>3.3 Classes</B></FONT>
<p>

j0.1 has only one class, within which the program is a set of static methods.
j0.2+ classes are a subset of Java classes:

<pre>
public class <em>tag</em> {
  <em>data</em>
  };
</pre>

j0 does not support nested classes inside other classes.
References to classes as fields within a class is allowed.
j0 does not have anonymous (non-labeled or lambda) classes.


<p>
<A NAME="DeclarationSyntax"></A><B><FONT SIZE=3>3.4 Declaration Syntax</B></FONT>
<p>

Declaration syntax is only allowed for global variables and at the top of
the bodies of function definitions, before the first executable statement.
j0 allows only simple initializers including int, float and char.

<pre>
type identifier;
type identifier [];
type identifier = literal;
</pre>

A slightly simpler syntax is allowed for parameter lists, which do
not allow initializers.
<p>

In Jzero Level One, only one identifier is declared with each
such variable declaration.  In Jzero Level Two, variable declarations may
be comma-separated lists of identifiers, each of which may have array or
initializer suffixes.

<h3><A NAME="Types">4. Data Types</A></h3>



<A NAME="Numbers"></A><B><FONT SIZE=3>4.1 Numbers</B></FONT>
<p>

All data types listed are used by j0 and are described in the reserved words section.
char, short, int, long, float, double

<p>

Although the C language automatically converts between numeric types as
needed (promotion and demotion), j0 does not.


<p>
<A NAME="Strings"></A><B><FONT SIZE=3>4.2 Strings</B></FONT> <BR>
<p>

These are usual C null-terminated char* arrays.
<p>

  Note that (void *) values automatically convert to any other pointer type,
  but no other pointer type conversions, nor casts, are supported in j0.
  I wouldn't care about supporting void * at all, if you want to implement
  malloc as returning char *, that's fine.

<p>
<A NAME="Arrays"></A><B><FONT SIZE=3>4.3 Arrays</B></FONT> <BR>
<p>

As listed in the introduction Java has multidimensional arrays whereas j0
single dimensional arrays. For example:

<p>
  <pre>int [] num = new int[100]; </pre>
<p>
  or
  <pre>int [] num;
num = new int[100]; </pre>
<p>  

Such array construction is the only use of reserved word
<code>new</code> in j0.
<p>
  
Java supports empty square brackets array syntax on either side of the
identifier, but j0 only supports empty square brackets on the left of
the identifier.

<h3><A NAME="Functions">4. Library Functions</A></h3>

j0 supports a small subset of the functionality of a small subset of Java's
standard libraries.

<p>

<table border><tr><th>Function<th>Import?<th>Use
<tr><td>System.out.println(s)<td><td>Prints to stdout, simplified
  <tr><td><td><td> random number
  <tr><td><td><td> string stuff
  <tr><td><td><td> ...
  </table>


<pre>
array .get() and .set()
System.out.print(s)
System.out.println(s)
String.charAt(n)
String.equals(s)
String.compareTo(s)  // ? do we need both this and equals()?
String.length()
String.toString(i) vs. String.valueOf()  ??
InputStream.read()   // ? is there a better input?
System.in.read() ?
  </pre>

At Jzero Level 2, add:

<pre>
String.substring(x,y)
java.util.Random.nextInt()
java.lang.Math.abs()
java.lang.Math.max()
java.lang.Math.min()
java.lang.Math.pow()
</pre>

At Jzero Level 3, add:

<pre>
String.indexOf()
String.split()
java.lang.Math.cos()
java.lang.Math.sin()
java.lang.Math.tan()
</pre>

<H3>Summary</H3>
</A>

Sure, j0 may be a toy language designed for a compiler class.
Even with only this much, it may provide a convenient notation for a
lot of simple programming tasks such as those faced by students in CSE 113.
