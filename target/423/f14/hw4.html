<h3> CS 445 HW#4 </h3>

Due: Monday November 24 1:30pm
<p>


Generate 3-address intermediate code for 120++.  Please turnin via cscheckin
an electronic copy of your whole project in a hw4.tar. You do not need to turn
in a paper copy.

<ul>
<li> Create abstract data type(s) for lists of 3-address instructions.
     Define integers for each opcode.  Implement operations to create
     a new list with one instruction, and list concatenation.
<li> You can include separate instructions for subscripting with strings
     and for subscripting with integers.
<li> Define a data type for "memory address". A memory address is a
     &lt;region,offset&gt; pair, where region is one of GLOBAL,
     PARAMETER, or LOCAL.  Offsets start with 0 in each region.
<li> Write out "declarations" (pseudocode instructions) for functions.
<li> For each variable in each symbol table, assign it a memory address.
     Compute offsets assuming ints, pointers, and array
     references require 8 bytes.
<li> Compute a synthesized attribute "location" for every expression.
     Allocate a "temporary variable" out of the LOCAL region for each
     value computed by an operator or function invocation.
<li> Compute a synthesized attribute "code" that builds
     a link list of 3-address instructions, and a memory address
     for each expression.
</ul>

Output from this phase should consist of a file containing intermediate
code instructions.  It should contain a .string region for string constants,
a .data region for global variables, and a .code region for instructions.
If the input was foo.cpp, the output file should be
named foo.ic ("intermediate code").  Output should always be written to
the current directory, so if the input was /usr/local/temp/foo.cpp the
output would still just be named foo.ic.

<p>
Example:
<p>

For an input file foo.as containing source code:
<p>
<table border>
<tr><td>
<pre>
int main() { printf("%d\n", 10+2); return 0;}
</table>
<p>

your output should look something like that below.
loc: is the local region
(offset from base pointer). const: is immediate mode (numeric constants).
string: is an offset into a string constant region (global, read-only).
Your output does <b>not</b> need to include the interpretation column,
just the output column.  "interpretation" here is just my explanation
to you. However, if your three address code does not look something like this,
I may require you to hand-annotate it with interpretation so I can read it.
<p>

<table border>
<tr><td> output <td> interpretation
<tr><td>
<pre>
.string	4
	%d\012\000
.code
main:
	addr	loc:0,string:0
	parm	loc:0
	add	loc:8,const:10,const:2
	parm	loc:8
	call	printf,16,loc:16
	return	const:0
</pre>
<td>
<pre>
declare string region 4 bytes
string data, &lt;= 16 bytes per line, non-printables given as octal escapes
code region
procedure pseudo instruction
store (address of) string region offset 0 in local offset 0
push contents of local offset 0
add immediates 10+2, result in local offset 8 (local 0-7 holds string addr)
push contents stored at local address offset 8
call printf, 16 bytes of parameters, result in local offset 16
return from main
</pre>
</table>

<h4> Notes </h4>
<ul>
<li> your executable should still be named "120"
<li> your program should accept and process an arbitrary
	number of source filenames on the command line
<li> take in files with .cpp extensions and write out corresponding
     intermediate code in files with a .ic (intermediate code) extension,
     using the filename conventions described above.
<li> write out the name of the file to standard out when you open it
<li> do NOT write out the tree, or other debugging information, by default;
     you may add command line options to print that info if you want.
<li> error messages should be written to <em>standard error</em> not stdout
<li> if ANY file has a lexical error,
     your process exit status should return 1,
     for a syntax error 2, for a semantic error 3, and for no errors,
     return 0.
</ul>
