<h3> CS 445 HW#2 </h3>

Due: Monday October 6 start of class. Do not print hard copies of
.tab.c (or lex.yy.c) files.  In addition to a cscheckin of a .tar file
named hw2.tar, I would like hard copies of your Makefile,
.y, .l, and other (non-generated) .{h,c,cpp} files.
<p>
<pre>
cscheckin -f hw2.tar -c cs445
</pre>

Write or find a C++ grammar that works with Bison and adapt it
to match the 120++ language.  Potential starting points are:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Ed Willink's <A href="Cxx/CxxGrammar.y">CxxGrammar.y</A> with accompanying
     <A href="Cxx/CxxLexer.l">CxxLexer.l</A> (1200 LOC, downloaded from
     <A href="http://www.willink.me.uk/">www.willink.me.uk</A>,
     license unclear, not recommended), or
<li> Sandro Sigala's <A href="parser.y">parser.y</A> and
     <A href="lexer.l">lexer.l</A> (1500 LOC, downloaded from
     <A href="http://www.sigala.it/sandro/software.php">www.sigala.it/sandro/software.php</A>, license explicitly allows mods and redistribution)
<li> The 120++ reference implementation mods of Sigala <A href="120pp/120gram.y">120gram.y</A>,
     <A href="120pp/120lex.l">120lex.l</A>,
and
     <A href="120pp/Makefile">Makefile</A>
     (work in progress, with help from you-all).
</ul>

Note that of these two, I have only tried Sigala's and believe it to "work",
as far as it goes, despite its reporting 100 reduce/reduce conflicts and 567
shift/reduce conflicts. I would normally advice students to ignore/allow
any number of shift/reduce conflicts, but to not tolerate any reduce/reduce
conflicts -- they generally require grammar changes such as refactoring
common sequences within two or more production rules.
Willink's did not have Bison conflicts but
is otherwise untested. Whatever grammar/parser you use, you are responsible
for making it work for 120++ and for any bugs. You may write
your own grammar if you prefer, although one or both of these correspond
fairly closely to (an old version of) the standard C++ grammar.  120++ does
not depend on recent additions to C++.

<p>
Your parser should include at least the following:
<ul>
<li> Rename terminal symbols from your HW#1 or from the .y file you use to be
compatible.
<li> Add terminal symbols required by the .y file, possibly adapting missing
     symbols' regular expressions from their .l file.
<li> Resolve matters regarding type names and the need to return
     different terminal symbol codes for "identifier" regular expressions,
     depending on syntactic context.
<li> For every production rule in the grammar:
<ul>
<li> if the production rule is not legal in 120++, add a
 <code>semantic_error("C++ operation not supported")</code> and set $$ = NULL.
<li> if the production rule is legal in 120++ and the right hand side
     has &gt; 1 children, add a semantic action to
     construct a construct a tree node and assign $$ to point at it
<li> if the production rule is legal in 120++ and the right hand side
     has 0 or 1 children, add a semantic action to set $$ to NULL
     (0 children) or to the child (if there is 1 child)
</ul>
<li> Place a pointer to your token in a yylval field on each call to yylex(),
     and ensure that those tokens get inserted as leaves into your syntax
     tree.
<li> If the parse succeeds, assign the root of the tree to a global variable
     from the semantic action associated with your start symbol.
<li> Revise the main() procedure from HW#1 to call yyparse() and use its
return value and/or global variables to ascertain whether the parse succeeded.
<li> If the parse succeeded, traverse/print your syntax tree as described below.
</ul>

<p>

If there is a syntax error, you should report the filename and line number.
Your program's exit status should be 0
if there are no errors, and a nonzero number to indicate errors. For
lexical errors, use the exit status 1. For syntax errors, the exit status
should be 2.  For "C++ operations not supported in 120++" the exit status
should be 3.
<p>

If there are no errors, you should print a text representation of a syntax
tree.
<p>
Suppose we have a tree structure that looks something like:

<pre>
struct tree {
   int prodrule;
   int nkids;
   struct tree *kids[9];
   struct token *leaf;
}

int treeprint(struct tree *t, int depth)
{
  int i;

  printf("%*s %s: %d\n", depth*2, " ", humanreadable(t->prodrule), t->nkids);
  
  for(i=0; i&lt;t-&gt;nkids; i++)
    treeprint(t->kids[i], depth+1);

}
</pre>

you might get output that looks something like

<pre>
program: 1
 function: 2
  function header: 3
   typedecl: 1
   functioname: 1
   parmlist: 3
    ....

</pre>

For leaves, print out the integer code and the lexeme (yytext[]) for the
token, if any.
