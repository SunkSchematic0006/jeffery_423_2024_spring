<h2> CSE 423 Lab #2: Lexical Testing </h2>

For today's lab, we are going to work on HW#2 as much as we can.
And think about how to test it sufficiently.


<h3> Lab Part 1: Team Up and Swap Notes (20 minutes) </h3>

<ol>
<li> Break into small groups, preferably of size three.  Zoom folks, maybe we
need breakout rooms for this.
<li> Share with each other the non-trivial regex'es that you have in your
     rustlex.l so far. Discuss each.
<li> If you have questions about what regular expression is correct,
     write those down as part of your lab submission.
<li> For each non-trivial regex, either agree unanimously, or by
     voting, which regular expressions are the most correct.
</ol>


<h3> Lab Part 2: Lex Testing </h3>

<ul>
<li> Write test cases for each token category, especially the non-trivial ones.
<li> Hello World is a <A href="lab2/test1.rs.html">test case</A> (<A href="lab2/test1.rs">.rs file</A>).
<li> It provides coverage for ten token categories.
<li> We should add one or more tests for everything in Rust that we identify.
<li> Test the boundary cases ("weird" and "bad" tokens).
<li> Unterminated strings
<li> Random binary garbage characters
<li> ...etc.
</ul>

Use the <A href="hw2.html#lextokens">tokens</A> from the HW#2 spec.

<h3> What to Turn in </h3>

Lab submission: turn in a .ZIP containing:

For Part 1, a PDF document that provides
<ul>
<li> your list of team members
<li> your list of which Rust tokens deserve non-trivial regexes.
<li> your group's (unanimous or vote-based) winners for these regex'es
<li> your list of questions
</ul>


For Part 2: include in the .zip your set of lexical test cases, in .rs files.

<p>

You will receive full credit for the lab if it looks like you did at least
three hours' worth of lab work.


<h3> Answers to Lab Questions </h3>

<dl>
<dt> Does "categories" mean the six kinds of Tokens Rust Docs talk about?
<dd> Nope, it means all the subcategories that are syntactically
     distinguishable

<dt> What do you mean, put the tokens in yylex()?
<dd> I mean, malloc() an instance of each token inside yylex() and initialize
     its fields before
     you return the integer category.  The type definition for tokens
     should be in a .h file.

<dt> How do I de-escape the string literals for the svals as shown in the HW#2
     example output?

<dd> You probably write a helper function and build an sval from yytext by
     doing a "modified copy" where most yytext characters are copied into
     the sval, but escaped characters in yytext map 2+ characters down to
     a single character in the sval.

<dt> It seems like you want a lot of stuff to be done inside yylex()
<dd> Yes, probably in 1+ helper functions called from the yylex()
     semantic actions code fragments.
